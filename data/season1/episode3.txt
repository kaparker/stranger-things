Oh! Jesus, you scared me.
Oh, I scared you? I know, I should have called.
Where have you been? We agreed on 10:00.
After the assembly, some people wanted to get something to eat.
I didn't think it'd be a big deal.
You didn't think to call and let me know? With everything that's been going on? I didn't realize how late it was, okay? I'm sorry, Mom.
What more do you want? Hey, wait Whose sweatshirt is that? Steve's.
Steve's.
So is Steve your boyfriend now? What? No! It was just cold, so I borrowed his sweatshirt.
It's not a big deal.
Nancy? What? You can talk to me.

- Mom - I know.
I know.
Just just watch.
Will your brother's here.
Can you show him what you showed me, baby? Please Did you see that? It's the electricity, Mom.
- It's acting up.
- No.
It's the same thing that fried the phone.
No! It is not the electricity, Jonathan.
Something is going on here! - Yesterday, the wall - What? What about the wall? - I don't know.
I don't know.
- Mom, first the lights, then the wall? I just know that Will is here.
No, Mom.
- Maybe if I get more lamps - No, Mom.
You don't need more lamps.
You need to stop this, okay? He is just lost.
People are looking for him, and they're going to find him.
Okay.
- This isn't helping.
- Okay, okay.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Can you do me a favor, Mom? Can you just try and get some sleep? - Yeah.
- Huh? Can you do that for me? - I promise.
I will.
- Yeah? - Yeah.
- I just need to sit here for a minute.
All right, I'll go make breakfast.
- Okay.
- Yeah? Will? We just tell our parents we have AV Club after school.
That'll give us at least a few hours for Operation Mirkwood.
You seriously think that the weirdo knows where Will is? - Just trust me on this, okay? - Okay.
- Did you get the supplies? - Yeah.
Binoculars from 'Nam.
Army knife also from 'Nam.
Hammer, camouflage bandana and the wrist rocket.
You're gonna take out the Demogorgon with a slingshot? First of all, it's a wrist rocket.
And second of all, the Demogorgon's not real.
It's made up.
But if there is something out there, I'm gonna shoot it in the eye - and blind it.
- Dustin, what did you get? Well, alrighty.
So, we've got Nutty Bars, Bazooka, Pez, Smarties, Pringles, Nilla Wafers, apple, - banana, and trail mix.
- Seriously? We need energy for our travels.
For stamina.
And besides, why do we even need weapons anyway? - We have her.
- She shut one door! With her mind! Are you kidding me? That's insane! Imagine all the other cool stuff she could do.
Like I bet that she could make this fly! Hey.
Hey.
Okay, concentrate.
Okay? Okay, one more time.
Okay.
Use your powers, okay? Idiot.
- She's not a dog! - Boys! Time for school! Just stay down here.
Don't make any noise, and don't leave.
If you get hungry, eat Dustin's snacks, okay? - Michael! - Coming! You know those power lines? - Power lines? - Yeah.
The ones behind my house? Yes.
Meet us there, after school.
After school? Yeah, 3:15.
Ah.
When the numbers read three-one-five, meet us there.
"Three-one-five.
" Three-one-five.
Hey! Hey! - Is everything okay? - Yeah! Yeah, totally.
I just I feel like everyone's staring at me.
Oh, I didn't I didn't tell anyone.
I know.
I know.
Of course not.
But what about, like, Tommy, and Carol and them? You're being paranoid.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
No, it's cute.
Hey I had a good time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Me, too.
Mmm.
Hmm.
Hey, Ally.
Where's Barb? Um, shouldn't you know? You haven't seen her anywhere at all? There she is.
Emerald City.
I heard they make space weapons in there.
Space weapons? Yeah.
You know, like, Reagan's Star Wars.
I guess we're gonna blow the Ruskies to smithereens.
Hey, can I help you? Uh, yeah.
We're here for a tour.
Oh, we don't give tours.
Okay A quick look around.
You have to get clearance for that.
You can contact, uh Rick Schaeffer at the Department of Energy.
Maybe you seen it on TV.
We got a local kid that's missing.
We have reason to believe he might have snuck in here.
Like I said, you have to speak to Mr.
Schaeffer.
- What's your name? - Patrick.
Patrick, I got a panicked mayor, and I got reporters breathing down my neck and I got a very upset mother.
Now, I know the kid's not in there, but I gotta check off this box.
Patrick, would you do me a favor? Would you speak to your boss and see what you can swing for us? I'd really appreciate it.
I'm talking ten minutes, tops.

Today, Syria has become a home for I have the power! gift that will last forever.
From the Harmony Treasures' collection On the beach and in the sun The real thing is so much fun All the times of your life And the things that you do Coke is right there with you Coke is it! Coke is it! - Joyce - Just ring me up, Donald.
And you think this missing boy may have crawled through there? Well, that was the idea.
Yeah, I just don't see how that'd be possible.
We've got over 100 cameras.
Every square inch covered, plus all my guys.
No one breaks in here.
Certainly not some kid.
Those cameras, you keep the tapes? If you don't mind me asking, what do you guys do in here? You're asking the wrong guy.
- Staying one step ahead of the Russians? - I expect.
Something like that.
- Who's in charge here? - That'd be Dr.
Brenner.
And he builds the space lasers? - Space lasers? - Ignore him.
This is the night of the 6th and 7th we're seeing here? That's correct.
Is that it? Like I said, we would have seen him.
The night of the 7th, we had a search party out for Will.
You remember anything about that night? Mmm, not much to remember.
Called it off.
- 'Cause of the storm.
- Yeah, a lot of rain that night.
You see any rain on that tape? What are you thinking? I don't know.
But they're lying.
That's why science doesn't make any damn sense to me.
No, I swear.
Look at this.
It's totally frostbite.
Oh, thanks, man.
It's a heated pool.
Well, if it's not frostbite, then what is it? Ugh, I don't care what it is, it's disgusting! Get it off the table.
We're eating here.
Ew! Hey, Tommy.
When you left, did you see Barb? - What? - Barbara.
She's not here today.
I seriously have no idea who you're talking about.
Come on, don't be an ass, man.
Did you Did you see her leave last night or not? No, she was gone when we left.
Probably couldn't stand listening to all that moaning.
Oh, Steve! - Oh, Steve! Oh, Steve! - Oh, Steve Oh, Steve! Okay, chill.
Listen I'm sure she's fine.
She's probably just she's probably just, like, skipping or something.
Yeah.
Yeah, probably.
- How about this one? - Too big for the sling.
So, do you think Eleven was born with her powers, like the X-Men, or do you think she acquired them, like like Green Lantern? She's not a superhero.
She's a weirdo.
Why does that matter? The X-Men are weirdos.
If you love her so much, why don't you marry her? What are you talking about? - Mike, seriously? - What? You look at her all, like "Hi, El! El! El! El! I love you so much! - Would you marry me?" - Shut up, Lucas.
Yeah, shut up, Lucas.
What are you losers doing back here? Probably looking for their missing friend.
That's not funny.
It's serious.
He's in danger.
I hate to break it to you, Toothless, but he's not in danger.
He's dead.
That's what my dad says.
He said he was probably killed by some other queer.
Come on.
Just ignore them.
Watch where you're going, Frogface.
- You all right? - Yeah.
Hey.
How about this one? - Yeah.
- Yeah? Yeah, this is it.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, this is the monster killer! Whoo! Hey.
Oh, hey.
- Hey! - Hey, Karen.
Hi I brought you a casserole.
Oh! Thank you, uh Uh, you wanna come in? Hey, Marissa.
How you doin'? You have a lot of nerve showing up here.
What? You could have at least called, said, "Marissa! Hey, it's not gonna work out.
Sorry I wasted your time.
I'm a dick.
" Yep.
I'm sorry.
Uh Maybe we could go out again next week? Newspapers? You guys got newspapers around here? We have the New York Times, the Post, all the big ones.

Well, shouldn't you be looking for that missing kid? Yeah.
We are.
Uh, so, why don't you start with the Times, and we'll check out the Post.

It's silly, I know.
No.
No, it's not silly.
How is Jonathan holding up? You know, he's good at taking care of himself.

But she did come home, right? After the vigil? No, she said she was staying with you last night.
Right, yes.
She did, sorry.
I meant, did she come home this morning? I think she left some textbooks and she was gonna go pick them up.
Oh, um, no, I haven't seen her.

See, you can tell that he knows it was wrong, but Man, that's the thing about perverts It's hardwired into 'em.
You know, they just can't help themselves.
So we'll just have to take away his toy.

Come on, man.
Work with me here.
I'm not saying that there's some grand conspiracy.
