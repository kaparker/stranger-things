Turning now to local news, we're getting reports of surges and power outages all across the county.
Last night, hundreds of homes in East Hawkins were affected, leaving many residents in the dark.
The cause of the outage is still unknown.
We reached out to Roane County Water and Electric, and a spokesperson says that they are confident power will be restored to all remaining homes within the next several hours.
Mmm.
