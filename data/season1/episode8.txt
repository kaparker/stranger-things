[insects chirping] [Joyce yelling] Let me out of here! Somebody, please! [grunts] Let me out! [door unlocking] [Joyce breathing heavily] [Dr.
Brenner] Your son.
We know you've been in contact with him.
- [stammering] You have to let me - When and how did you make contact with him? - What? - Hmm? Six.
What? Six.
Six people have been taken this week.
This thing that took your son [softly] we don't really understand it.
But its behavior is predictable.
Like all animals it eats.
It will take more sons.
More daughters.
I want to save them.
I want to save your son.
But I can't do that.
Not without your help.
Stop.
I know who you are.
I know what you've done.
You took my boy away from me! You left him in that place to die! You faked his death! We had a funeral.
We buried him.
And now you're asking for my help? Go to hell.
- [electricity crackling] - [groaning] - [breathing heavily] - Okay, now what do you know? I'm sorry.
Did I stutter? I told you.
Everything.
[electricity crackling] What do you know? [panting] I know you do experiments on kidnapped little kids, whose parents' brains you've turned to mush.
And I know you went a little too far this time and you messed up in a big way.
I mean, you really messed up, didn't you? Big time.
That's why you're trying to cover your tracks.
You killed Benny Hammond, you faked Will Byers' death.
You made it look like that little girl just ran away.
See, I told you.
- I know everything.
- All right, who are you working with? Nobody.
But I did give all this over to my friend at the Times.
He's gonna blow this thing wide open.
[chuckles] - [electricity crackling] - [groans] [grunting] You're just a junkie.
A small town cop who had a really bad week.
Took one too many pills this time.
You made a mistake coming back here.
No, I didn't.
Here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna let me and Joyce Byers go you're gonna give us anything we need, and we're gonna find her son.
And then we're gonna forget that any of this ever happened.
Oh, is that right? Yeah.
That's right.
Nancy? Jonathan? [door closes] - They're gone.
- What? Nancy and Jonathan.
His car's gone.
They're probably just sucking face somewhere.
- [Lucas] Gross.
- No.
No way! Did they go with the chief? I don't know.
No.
What? Did you see them? Do you know where they went? - Yes.
- Where? Where did they go? Demogorgon.
[sighs] Where's the girl? [inhales deeply] [exhales] You gotta give me your word.
Nobody's ever gonna find out about this.
And those other three kids, those boys, you're gonna leave them alone.
Then I'll tell you.
Tell you where your little science experiment is.
[sighs] [gasps] I don't understand.
We came to an agreement.
What? Look, everything that's happened here and everything that's gonna happen, we don't talk about.
You want Will back? This place had nothing to do with it.
That's the deal.
You got it? What is this? Protection.
The atmosphere is toxic.
[stutters] But my son's in there.
He Put it on.
[Connie] I'm telling you, this is a mistake.
[Dr.
Brenner] It's gone.
Isn't that what you wanted? And if they find the boy? That's not gonna happen.
[low growling] [theme music playing] [Joyce breathing heavily] [Hopper] Hey, you all right? [Joyce] Yeah.
[Hopper echoing] I need you to relax, okay? I want you to slow down your breathing, take deep breaths.
In and out.

[Mike] Guys, guys! This is crazy.
We can't just wait around.
Mike, in case you forgot, we're still fugitives.
The bad men are still looking for us.
Yeah, and we don't even know where your sister is.
El can find them.
Mike, look at her.
I still think we should stick to the chief's plan.
Exactly.
We stay here, keep El out of sight and keep her safe.
That's the most important thing, remember? Besides, she's okay.
She's with Jonathan.
Yeah, and she's kind of a badass now, so Well, where are you going? You just said stick to the plan! I am.
I'm just gonna go get some chocolate pudding.
I'm telling you, Lunch Lady Phyllis hoards that shit.
[Mike] Are you serious? El needs to be recharged! [door opens] [door shuts] [faint creaking] Did you hear that? It's just the wind.
Don't worry.
My mom, she said the lights speak when it comes.
Speak? Blink.
Think of them as alarms.
Is that too tight? [stutters] No, it's fine.
Thanks.
Nancy? Yeah? - [banging on door] - [both gasp] [Steve] Jonathan? Are you there, man? It's it's Steve! Listen, I just want to talk! [banging on door continues] - Steve, listen to me.

Okay, is this a joke? Stop.
Put the gun down.

[electricity jolts] Do you hear anything? No.
[door opening] [Joyce echoing] Will! Will! [breathing heavily] Will! Will! [indistinct sobbing] [Hopper] "I asked Mrs.
Spencer what made them red and she said she didn't know and for pity's sake not to ask her any more questions.
She said I must have asked her a thousand already.
I suppose I had, too, but how are you gonna find things out if you don't ask questions? And what does make roads red? 'Well, I don't know, ' said Matthew.
It just makes me feel glad to be alive it's such an interesting world.
" [sobbing] [Joyce yelling] Will! [Hopper] Will! [Steve muttering] This is crazy.
This is crazy.
This is crazy.
This is crazy! This is crazy! This is crazy! What are you do What are you doing? Are you insane? It's going to come back! So you need to leave.
Right now.
[electricity pulsating] [both breathing heavily] [Nancy] Where is it? [Jonathan] Come on.
Come on, you son of a bitch.
- You see it? - No.
Where Come on.
Where are you? Come on! [low growling] - Jonathan! - [growling] [yelps] - [groaning] - Jonathan! Jonathan! [monster growling] Go to hell, you son of a bitch! [sputters] [gun clicking] [Steve grunting] - [Nancy] Steve! - [monster roars] [Steve grunting] [Jonathan] He's in the trap! - He's stuck! - [Nancy] Jonathan, now! [monster screeching] Did you hear that? [screeching continues faintly] Get back! [grunting] - [Jonathan panting] - [all coughing] [all panting] [Nancy] Where did it go? [Jonathan] No.
It has to be dead.
[panting] It has to be.
[Hopper] Come on.
[Joyce] Is that my house? [door creaking] [Jonathan gasps] [Jonathan sighs] [Hopper] It was hurt.
[Steve panting] Mom.
[Jonathan echoing] Is that you? Mom.
Jonathan? [Hopper] Joyce, come on.
[crackling] Where's it going? I don't think that's the monster.
Found it! I knew she was hoarding it.
- I knew it.
- Yeah.
Always lying, saying she's out.
Bald-faced liar.
Mike, I found the chocolate pudding! Okay! Are you feeling any better? [sighs] What's "putting"? [chuckles] Pudding, it's it's this chocolate goo you eat with a spoon.
Don't worry, when all this is over, you won't have to keep eating junk food and leftovers like a dog anymore.
My mom, she's a pretty awesome cook.
She can make you whatever you like.
Eggos? Well, yeah, Eggos, but real food, too.
[sighs] See, I was thinking, once all this is over and Will's back and you're not a secret anymore, my parents can get you an actual bed for the basement.
Or you can take my room if you want, since I'm down there all the time anyways.
My point is, they'll take care of you.
They'll be like your new parents, and Nancy, she'll be like your new sister.
Will you be like my brother? What? No, no.
[scoffs] Why "no"? Because [sighs] 'cause it's different.
Why? [sighs] I mean, I don't know, I guess it's not.
It's stupid.
Mike? Yeah? Friends don't lie.
[sighing] Well I was thinking I don't know maybe we can go to the Snow Ball together.
- "Snow Ball"? - It's this cheesy school dance, where you go in the gym and dance to music and stuff.
I've never been, but I know you're not supposed to go with your sister.
- No? - I mean you can, but it'd be really weird.
You go to school dances with someone that, you know someone that you like.
- A friend? - Not a friend.
[sighs] Uh uh Uh, someone like a [car approaching] Nancy.
Hold on, I'll be right back.
Stay here.
[tires screeching] - [tires screeching] - [indistinct yelling] [agent] Go! You two, on me.
This will charge your battery right up, I'm telling you.
- [Mike] Guys! Guys! - What is it? [panting] They found us.
[agent] We know they're here.
Be advised, west side of the building is clear.
[agent] Sir, we've searched everywhere.
There's no sign of them.
[indistinct radio chatter] [agent] Nothin'.
Keep it locked down.
[agent] All right.
Kitchen.
[indistinct radio chatter] [panting] How did they find us? I don't know, but they knew we were in the gym.
Lando.
[agent] Got 'em! [Mike] Go, go, go, go, go! [Lucas] Come on! [agents yelling indistinctly] - There they are.
Freeze.
- [Mike] Back! Go back! [Mike] Go, go! Go left! [indistinct yelling] - [squelching] - [choking] [Eleven thuds] [Mike panting] El, are you okay? El! - Something's wrong.
- She's just drained.
No, no, no, she won't wake up.
El! El! [echoing] El! [Hopper] There's more blood.
Oh, my God.
[Joyce] This way.
- She's barely breathing.
- We gotta go.
[Dr.
Brenner] Leave her.
- Step away from the child.
- [Mike] No! You want her, you have to kill us first.
- That's right! - Eat shit! - Oh, no! No, no! - No! No! Get off me! - [screaming] You idiot! - No! [Dustin] Get off me! [Mike] Ow! Let go! Eleven? Eleven, can you hear me? Eleven? Papa? Yes, yes, it's your papa.
- [Mike] Get off of me.
[grunts] - [Dr.
Brenner] I'm here now.
Let her go! Let her go, you bastard! [whimpering] Shh, shh, you're sick.
You're sick, but I'm going to make you better.
I'm going to take you back home, where I can make you well again.
Where we can make all of this better, so no one else gets hurt.
Bad.
Bad.
Mike.
Mike.
- [grunts] - Mike.
[electricity spiking] Blood.
What? Blood.
[thudding] [screeching] Demogorgon.
[Mike] Go, go, go, go, go! - [guns firing] - [indistinct shouting] [Mike] Come on, come on.
[Lucas] Go, go! [monster screeching] [indistinct shouting] [yells] [under breath] Oh, my God.
Will! Will! Will! Oh, my God! Will! Hopper! Oh, my God! You need to help get him out! [Joyce crying] Get him out! [Joyce whimpers] - [grunts] - [tendril hissing] Oh, Jesus.
- [guns firing] - Come on, come on! [Dustin] Oh, my God! [agents yelling indistinctly] Sorry.
Hold on, we're almost there.
We're almost there.
Come on.
[panting] Come on.
Help, help.
Come on, get her on the table.
[Eleven groans] [sighs] Just hold on a little longer, okay? [sniffles] He's gone.
The bad man's gone.
We'll be home soon, and my mom she'll get you your own bed.
You can eat as many Eggos as you want.
[sniffles] And we can go to the Snow Ball.
[softly] Promise? [sniffles] Promise.
- [monster screeching] - [screams] [gunfire] [thudding] [gunfire continues] [gunfire stops] [Dustin stutters] Is Is it dead? [Mike] Go, go, go, go! [Dustin] Get the wrist rocket! Get the wrist rocket now! - [Mike] Go, go, go, go, go! - [monster roaring] - Go, go, go.
- [Dustin] Take it out now! Get the rocks, get the rocks, get the rocks! Getting the rocks! - Give me one.
- [Dustin] Come on! - Go! Go! Kill it! Kill it! - Fire! Fire! [roaring] - Give me another one.
- Kill it! Bastard! [Mike] Kill it! Go, go, go, go! [Dustin] Kill it now! Get, get, get Come on, kill the bastard! It's not working! - Hit him again.

- Okay.
One, two, three, four.
Now when I tell you, you're gonna pinch his nostrils, and breathe into his mouth - twice.

Her pulse ox is falling.

You're safe.
Jonathan.
Yeah, it's me, buddy.
[sighs] We missed you.
We really missed you.
Are you okay? What, this? It's just a cut.
It's nothing.
You're worried about my hand.
[both chuckle softly] [Jonathan] Oh, hey, uh We, uh We brought you some stuff so you don't get bored in here.
So [sniffles] Uh, I made you a new mix tape.

Be careful with him.
[Dustin] Move.
[Jonathan] Guys, guys.
- [Mike laughs] - [Jonathan] Go easy on him.
You won't believe what happened when you were gone, man.
- It was mental.
- [Lucas] You had a funeral.
- Jennifer Hayes was crying.
- And Troy peed himself.
- What? - In front of the whole school! - [Lucas] Yes! - [coughing] You okay? It got me.
The Demogorgon.
We know.
It's okay.
It's dead.
We made a new friend.
She stopped it.
She saved us.
But she's gone now.
- Her name's Eleven.
- Like the number? Well, we call her "El" for short.
She's basically a wizard.
[whispers] She has superpowers.
More like a Yoda.
[Dustin] She flipped a van with her mind, and these agents were trying to shoot us - Yeah, it flipped over us - Then she squeezed the brains out [Dustin] And blood was pouring out of their faces.
[Mike] It was pouring out of their eyes.
[Lucas] Agents just started grabbing us and stuff - [Dustin] shot out of the wall - [continues indistinctly] [Mike] Something is coming.
Something angry.
Hungry for your blood.
It is almost here.
- What is it? - It's the thessalhydra, I'm telling you.
It's not the thessalhydra.
I'm telling you, it's the thessalhydra.
- [loud thud] - The thessalhydra! - Damn it.
- [Mike] It roars in anger! - Will, your action! - What should I do? I Fireball him! Fireball the son of a bitch.
- Fourteen! - [all exclaim] Direct hit.
Will the Wise's fireball hits the thessalhydra.
It makes a painful [imitates screeching] and then it crumbles to the ground.
Its clawed hand reaches for you one last time and, and, and and [all cheering] Lucas cuts off its seven heads, and Dustin places them into his bag of holding.
You carry the heads out of the dungeon, victorious, and you present them to King Tristan.
He thanks you for your bravery and service.
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not it, is it? No, there's a medal ceremony Oh, a medal ceremony? What are you talking about? - And - The campaign was way too short.
