Is everything okay? Yes.
[PHONE RINGING] Hello, this is the Wheelers.
[ELEVEN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] Yeah, just a sec.
Mike! Phone! Okay! Hello? [SIGHS] It's 9:32.
Where are you? Sorry, I I was just about to call.
I, um can't see you today.
What Why not? It's my Nana.
She's very sick.
But Hop said that your Nana was okay, that it was a false alarm.
Yeah.
That's what we thought it was at first, but then she took a real turn for the worse.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
We think she might - die.
- What? Mom! Get off the phone! [MIKE] How many times?! Did Nana call?! No, Mom! Just get off the phone! [SCOFFS] [SIGHS] Sorry about that.
- Was that your mom? - Yeah.
She's so upset, she's making no sense.
Because we have to go to the nursing home.
To see Nana.
- You can come over after? - No! I mean, I I just think I need to be alone today.
With my feelings? Do you lie? What? No.
Friends don't lie.
What, Mom? My mom's calling me.
Better go.
Talk to you tomorrow.
Miss you already.

Yes, I think it worked! Yes! [HOPPER LAUGHS] No, stop.
It's all you.
I'm a puppet, you're the master.
So you remembered everything? [LAUGHS] Yeah, yeah.
I mean, I had to improvise a little bit, you know? It turns out, getting to Mike, now that was the key.
And you didn't yell at him? I'll tell you everything over dinner.
I was thinking, you know, Enzo's, tonight, 7:00.
Hey, before you say no, I'd I'd like to make one thing crystal clear.
This is not a date.
Wait, a date? You never said anything about a date.
I know, I didn't say anything about a date.
I just wanted to clear it up in case there was any confusion on your part.
- There's not.
- Great.
It's just two friends getting together for a nice dinner.
I mean, we've earned it, haven't we? I can't be out late.

I know, I just, um I really need to go to the doctor.
I've been having some um girl problems.
[COUGHS NERVOUSLY] - Oh, come on! The light! - Let's go.
Look, I just I just don't know if this is such a good idea anymore.
Really? Because I feel like it's the best idea I've had all summer.
Look, all I'm saying is, what harm is there in asking? The harm in asking is that Tom will say no.
We ask for forgiveness, not permission.
And if this story's as good as I think it's gonna be, then Tom won't care.
In fact, he'll thank us.
Or the old lady is nuts and the story blows up in our face and Tom fires us.
And then we never have to work at this shithole again.

She knows I'm lying.
- I don't even understand.
Why lie? - Hopper.
He threatened me.
- Did he say he'd kill you? - What? No.
- So then, what's the big deal? - The big deal is if I don't do what he says, then he'll stop me from seeing El.
Like, permanently.
- You don't understand, Lucas.
He's crazy.
- [SIGHS] He's lost his mind.
Hey, guys, I'm almost set up here.
I had no choice, Lucas.
I really had no choice.
I just wish you'd consulted me, because the way you handled this, you're in deep shit.
You're going to stop calling him.
You're going to ignore his calls.
As far as you're concerned, he doesn't exist.
Doesn't exist? He treated you like garbage.
You're gonna treat him like garbage.
Give him a taste of his own medicine.
Give him the medicine.

Why are you listening to the music, Steve? Listen to the Russian! - We're translating Russian! - I'm trying to listen to the Russian, - but there's music - All right, babysitting time is over.
You need to get in there.

That was important data, shitbirds.
I guarantee you, what we're doing is way more important than your data.
Yeah? And how do you know these Russians are up to no good anyways? - How does she know about the Russians? - I don't know.
- You told her about - It wasn't me.
Hello, I can hear you.
Actually, I can hear everything.
You are both extremely loud.
You think you have evil Russians plotting against our country, on tape, and you're trying to translate, but haven't figured out a word because you didn't realize Russians use an entirely different alphabet than you do.

- [BOTH] Why? - 'Cause maybe I can help.
- I'm fluent in four languages, you know.

We're from The Hawkins Post.
Oh! Oh, yes! Oh, my goodness.
Oh.
You look too young for reporters.
- We get that a lot.
- [MRS.
DRISCOLL CHUCKLES] Follow me.
[NANCY] Oh, it's it's lovely.
Um, do you live here all alone? Yes.
Jack, my husband, he passed away, what is it now, ten years ago.
Oh, um I'm I'm so sorry.
Oh, don't be.
I kinda like the quiet.
At least, I did.
[DOOR HINGE CREAKS] This way.
[STEPS CREAKING] It's right over there.
[MRS.
DRISCOLL] You see those little teeth marks, don't ya? And these bags, um you're sure they were full before? I'm old, honey, not senile.
Bought them over at Blackburn's Supplies just last Tuesday.
Now you tell me, why would rats want to eat a poor old woman's fertilizer? Are you sure they did? Maybe they just gnawed the bag? I mean eating fertilizer seems Crazy.
Believe me, I know, honey.
But [SIGHS] something's not right with these rats.
What does that mean, exactly "not right"? Rabies, my guess.
That's when I said to myself, "Doris, you gotta call the paper.
" Because if those diseased rats are runnin' loose, the people, they oughta know.
" Wouldn't you agree? [CRASHING SOUND] Oh, yes, I forgot to mention! Come on over here.

[LAUGHS] Calm down, now.
You don't even know what I want.
You don't like your fan club, you want me to shut 'em down.
Sound about right? [LAUGHS] When'd you get so serious? Take a seat.
- [PROTESTERS CHEERING] - [PROTESTER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [CLEARS THROAT DRAMATICALLY] [GRUNTS] My fan club, as you call them, now, you know why they're out there, don't ya? They're not actually fans? [CHUCKLES] They lost their jobs to the mall and blame me for helping make that happen.
Now, you go ask anyone else in this town.
They all love the mall.
It's helped our economy grow, brought in new jobs, and just some incredible new stores.
Which is why they all stopped shopping at their, uh, mom-and-pops.
Now, that's not me, Jim.
- Mm-hmm? - Uh-uh.
That's just, uh, good old fashioned American capitalism.
Well, Larry, I think that they're just exercising their good old fashioned American right to protest.
- [GRUNTS] - I agree.
- Yeah.
- If.
If they had a permit.
Now, correct me if I'm wrong here, Jim, but, uh I don't believe they secured a permit from your office, did they? Not that I'm aware of.
Then I do believe it's within my right to get rid of them.
Larry, I'm not a politics guy, but I think if you force those people out of here without provocation, I don't think that's a good look for your re-election campaign.
["AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL" PLAYING] You know what's in four days, Jim? Independence Day? That's right.
And I'm gonna throw this town the biggest bash it's ever seen.

You know why? 'Cause at the end of the day, that's all the voters will remember.

Against the rules.

What's the worst that could happen? [UPBEAT SYNTH MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] So, what should we do first? [LAUGHS] You've never been shopping before, have you? Well, then I guess we're just gonna have to try everything.
Ooh.
Come on.
I just I don't understand what we're looking for.
Something pretty and shiny that says "I'm sorry".
What, just something that literally says "I'm sorry"? No! [CASH REGISTER BEEPING] Do you like that? How do I know what I like? You just try things on.

[CRICKETS CHIRPING] [JOYCE] And what is this again? This is a solenoid.
It's a coil, wrapped around a metallic core, and when electricity passes through it It creates an electromagnetic field.
Exactamundo.
Now for the fun part.
- Shall we? - Yeah.
[ELECTRIC HUM] I I don't see anything.
Nope.
You can't see it, but it's there, I assure you.
Our very own Clarke-Byers Electromagnetic Field.
Pretty neato, huh? Yeah.
And this field affects any charged object in its vicinity.
- Just like my magnets.
- Just like your magnets.
Okay, why is nothing happening? Oh, because our field is stable.
But, if we reduce the current How The magnetic dipoles tried to orient according to the field, but No, no, no, I mean, how is this happening at my house? You want my honest opinion? One of your kiddos got up in the middle of the night, bumped into the fridge, and knocked the suckers loose.
And the magnets at Melvald's? - Apophenia.
- Apo-what-o-whah? Apophenia.
Uh You're seeing patterns that aren't there.
Coincidence.
But what if it's not? Well Theoretically-speaking, I suppose some large version of this AC transformer could exist.
A machine of some kind.
A machine? But, in order to reach your house and downtown, gosh, that would take billions of volts of electricity and cost tens of millions of dollars.
But it is possible.
We cured polio in '53.
Landed on the moon in '69.
As I tell my students, once you open up that curiosity door, anything is possible.
[ROBIN, DUSTIN, AND STEVE] "The week is long", the silver cat feeds, "when blue meets yellow in the west".
I mean, it just it just can't be right.
- [ROBIN] It's right.
- Honestly, I think it's great news.
How is this great news? [CHUCKLES] I mean, so much for being American heroes.
- It's total nonsense.
- It's not nonsense.
It's too specific.
It's obviously a code.
- What do you mean, a code? - Like a super secret spy code.
- That's a total stretch.
- [ROBIN] I don't know, is it? You're buying into this? Listen, just for kicks, let's entertain the possibility that it is a secret Russian transmission.
What'd you think they were gonna say, "Fire the warhead at noon"? - Exactly.
- And my translation is correct.
I know that for sure, so "The silver cat feeds".
Why would anyone talk like that unless they're trying to mask - the meaning of their message? - Exactly.
Why would anyone mask the true meaning of their message unless the message was somehow sensitive? Exactly.
- So I guess that confirms your suspicion.
- Evil Russians.
I can't believe I'm about to agree with this strange child, but, yeah, totally evil Russians.
So how do we crack it? Well, I guess we translate the rest and hopefully a pattern emerges.
A pattern.
Right, like maybe "silver cat" is a meeting place? Or a person.
Or a weapon.
It's probably gonna take a super genius to crack it, but Where's Steve? - [ROBIN] Hey, Steve.
- [COINS CLATTER] What are you doing? Uh, it's a quarter.
