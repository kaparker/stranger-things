1 [THUNDER RUMBLING] [BILLY] I'm sorry, I did not quite catch your name.
[DISTORTED SCREAMING] [MAX] What happened? Help me.
[SCREAMING] No! [THUNDERCLAP] Which one? I don't know.
Hey, there's nothing to worry about anymore, okay? It doesn't make sense.
What doesn't make sense? Heather.
The blood.
The ice.
Heather had a fever, so she took a cold bath, but she's better now.
That has to be it.
I don't know where that blood came from, but we saw her.
We both saw her.
She's totally fine.
What about Billy? What about him? He seemed wrong.
[CHUCKLES] Wrong is kind of like his default.
But it's nice to know he's not a murderer, because that would've totally sucked.
[CHUCKLES] Who is that? See, this is why you can't just hang out with Mike all the time.
This is Wonder Woman.
AKA Princess Diana.
She's from Paradise Island, which is, like, this hidden island where there are only women Amazon warriors.
[THUNDER RUMBLING] [MRS.
DRISCOLL SCREAMING] Let me go! Let me go! Doris, we need you to stay calm for us, okay? - Stay calm.
- I have to go back! I have to go back! I have to go back! I have to go back! Okay, so, you two want to explain to me what in the name of Jesus just happened here? [AMBULANCE DOORS CLOSING] [SIREN WAILING] [MUFFLED SCREAMING] [SHRIEKING] [PANTING] [STRAINING] [MUFFLED] Tom! [SOBBING] [TOM SOBS] - [ECHOING FOOTSTEPS] - [GASPS] [TOM WHIMPERS] Hi, Daddy.
Heather sweetie whatever this is, whatever he's got you into, you don't have to do this.
You can stop this.
There is no stopping it, Daddy.
[GASPS] You'll see.
[JANET SOBBING] No.
[WHIMPERING] [SOBBING] [WHIMPERING] Heather, please! Heather! Try not to move.
No.
No.
- [GASPS] - [GRUNTS] Heather! Heather! [CREATURE SNARLING] [ROARING] Jesus Christ.
[HEAVY FOOTSTEPS] [SNARLING AND ROARING] [TOM WAILS] [TOM] No.
[SNARLING] [TOM] No [SCREAMING] [MUFFLED GRUNTS] [CREATURE SNARLING] [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRDSONG] [GROANS] [COUGHS] [JOYCE] Hey, careful.
- [VOICE ECHOING] Careful.
- [HOPPER COUGHS] Here.
Hey.
Joyce.
[HOPPER SIGHS] [RETCHING] Oh.
Here, here, here.
[COUGHING, VOMITING] It's okay.
[LOUD VOMITING] That's it.
Got it? [GROANS] - Here.
- How long have I been out? A while.
You've been drifting in and out.
Yeah, but how did I get here? Slowly.
- What's the last thing you remember? - Some thug attacked me.
- Hey, you need to rest.
- No, I'm fine.
- No, you're not fine, Hop - I'm fine.
I'm fine.
[EXCLAIMS] Um - Where are my clothes? - Uh Uh [SHARP EXHALE] They were soaked.
I mean, did you recognize him? - Who? - The thug.
[HOPPER] Well, I didn't get a good look.
Well, I mean, he's gotta be government, right? Yeah, but if he's government, what's he doing slinking around? W-Why is he running? You know, why didn't we find anything down there? Let's ask him.
What is that? His license plate.
- What are the dashes? - Well, they're blanks.
There was I think it was either an H or a P with the part rubbed off.
And there was definitely a Y.
For sure.
And that, I think, was a B, but it could've been an eight.
And that Wait I think you should stick to sales.
Can't you run a search or something? I just think you have to lower your expectations.
I mean, this is a state government agency.
Gonna take weeks before they find a match.
- Weeks? - If we're lucky.
And, I mean, what are the odds that this guy registers a car in his own name? It wasn't a car.
[CLEARS THROAT] Uh, what are you wearing? What do you mean it wasn't a car? [LUCAS OVER RADIO] Do you copy? This is a code red.
[RADIO STATIC POPS] I repeat, this is a code red.
Max.
Do you copy? - This is a code red.
- [MAX SCOFFS] Shut up.
She turned it off.
[PHONE RINGING] [SCOFFS] You've got to be kidding me.
I'm sleeping.
Go away.
[MIKE] This is Mike.
Do not hang up.
Something happened, something bad.
Our very lives can be at stake.
- What are you talking about? - Just come over to my house.
We'll explain everything.
- [MAX] What? - Hurry.
[CLICK, DIAL TONE DRONES] What did he say? Try Dustin again.
He's not answering.
So, try him again.
Dustin, do you copy? I repeat, this is a code red.
[DUSTIN] That keycard opens the door, but unfortunately, the Russian with this keycard also has a massive gun.
Whatever's in this room, whatever's in those boxes, they really don't want anybody finding it.
But there's gotta be a way in.
Well, you know I could just take him out.
- Take who out? - The Russian guard.
What? I sneak up behind him, I knock him out, and I take his keycard.
It's easy.
Did you not hear the part about the massive gun? Yes, Dustin, I did.
And that's why I would be sneaking.
Ah.
Well, please, tell me this, and be honest, have you ever actually won a fight? Okay, that was one time Twice.
Jonathan.
Year prior? Listen, that doesn't count.
Why wouldn't it? Because it looks like he beat the shit out of you.
- It was - You got a fat lip, crooked nose, - swollen eye, a lot of blood - things that all added up That just might work.
[STEVE] Robin.
Hey, Robin! Hey, what what are you doing? - I need cash.
- Well, half of that's mine.
- Where're you going? - To find a way into that room, a safe way.
And, in the meantime, sling ice cream, behave, and don't get beat up.
I'll be back in a jiff.
Oh, dude.
Come on, man, not my scooper.
[PHONE RINGING] [DRAWER OPENS, CLOSES] [MAN] If he gets us the layout by noon, we can.
[WOMAN] Okay, I'll let him know.
[MAKES CHOKING NOISE] [LAUGHS] Dunno if they'll go through with it, but I just thought you should know.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Nancy.
Jonathan.
[TOM] I've worked at this paper for twenty-five years.
Twenty-five years.
Now, we're a small-town paper, but we have something the big papers don't have: trust.
- The trust of our community.
- Tom, if you just Do you know how I built that trust? By placing my faith in something the two of you don't seem to value a whole lot: facts.
Facts.
So, while we're here, let's go over the facts.
Fact one: you disobeyed a direct order to stop pursuing this story.
Two: you falsely identified yourselves as reporters, repeatedly lying to an elderly woman.
Three: you broke into her home, committing trespass.
Four: she almost died en route to the hospital.
She would've died if we hadn't shown up! Whatever disease that rat had clearly passed to her Five! Mrs.
Driscoll is a paranoid schizophrenic.
You didn't know that, did you? Now disease-carrying rats? The second coming of the plague? Does this sound credible to you, or perhaps does this sound more like the delusions of a very sick old lady? - I didn't know that.
- Her family's furious.
So furious, in fact, they've threatened litigation.
- Litigation? - That's crazy.
For once, we agree.
This is crazy.
In fact, in my entire professional career, I've never dealt with anything quite like it.
But hopefully, hopefully, you've learned something valuable here.
You've learned how in the workplace, in the real world, there are consequences to your actions.
Which brings me to my sixth and final fact.
You're fired.
Both of you.
[WILL] I didn't think it was anything at first.
I mean, I think I just didn't want to believe it.
The first time I felt it was at Day of the Dead.
[FLUTTERING SOUND] - Power went out that night, too.
- And then I felt it again at the field near the Nelson farm the next day.
[GASPS] Then again yesterday outside Castle Byers.
[FLUTTERING SOUND] [LUCAS] Will! What does it feel like? It's almost like You know when you drop on a roller coaster? - Sure.
- Yeah.
- No.
- It's like everything inside your body is just sinking all at once, but this is worse.
Your body it goes cold and and you can't breathe.
I've felt it before, whenever he was close.
- [THUNDERCLAP] - [SNARLING] Whenever who was close? The Mind Flayer.
Go away! Go away! I closed the gate.
I know, but what if he never left? What if we locked him out here with us? This is him.
All of him.
But, that day on the field, a part of him attached itself to me.
[HYPERVENTILATING] My mom got it out of me Get the hell out of my son! and Eleven closed the gate.
[SCREAMING] But the part that was still in me, what if it's still in our world? In Hawkins.
I don't understand.
The Demodogs died when El closed the gate.
[MAX] If the brain dies, the body dies.
We can't take any chances.
We need to assume the worst.
The Mind Flayer's back.
[WILL] Yeah.
And if he is, he'd want to attach himself to someone again.
A new me.
A new host.
How can you tell if someone is a host? [HOPPER GRUMBLES] Hey, is he in? - Yes, he's busy at the moment, but - Great.
Excuse me.
You should sit down.
wouldn't listen Uh Tony, hold on.
Let me, uh I might have to Let me call you back.
Okay.
Thanks.
- Jim.
- I know, I know.
You're busy.
I'm gonna make this fast, I promise.
Is there some kind of problem? Yeah.
You might say that.
Um, I'm looking for the name of a guy.
The name of a guy.
Yeah, I think you might know this guy.
- Okay.
- He was here the other day.
Rides a motorcycle.
Big build, square jaw, dark hair.
He's probably military, maybe ex-military? Is this ringing any bells? Uh [CHUCKLES] I don't think so.
Really? 'Cause it was just two days ago.
This was right before I saw you.
Oh! - You know what? - What? Could be the maintenance guy.
- Maintenance.
- Yeah.
I can't remember his name.
Oh, God Uh Gary or John or something.
Candice will have his name on file.
We've had trouble with the plumbing.
Clogged toilets and sinks with minds of their own.
[CHUCKLES] You meeting with a lot of plumbers, Larry? Excuse me? This guy, when I saw him, he was coming out of your office.
Okay, well, I don't remember that.
I shake a lot of hands, you know? Do you remember when I caught you passed out in the hideaway with all that powder all over your nose? - You remember? - Jim, come on, now.
Do you remember when my boys found you and Candice going at it like a couple of bunnies in the back of your Cadillac? Do you remember that? Does your wife remember that? You, uh [CLEARS THROAT] You really wanna play this game? Huh? Not a game, Lar.
Okay.
Those pills you used to swallow like candy.
I can't recall, did you have a prescription for those? Or how about drinking on duty? [CHUCKLING] Yeah.
We have some real fun stories about that.
[CHUCKLES] One call to Tom at the Post and you're done, buddy.
You're gone.
Oh, and, please, don't give me that dead daughter sob story, 'cause I just don't care.
Now, if you don't mind, I really am rather busy.
Operating directors [LARRY GRUNTS] Damn it! [WAILING] My nose! You broke my goddamn nose! And your friend almost killed me last night, so I'd say we're still not even.
Larry? - [HOPPER] Let's cut the crap, Larry! - Larry! - Who is this guy? Government? Military? - You're making a big mistake.
Who is he? It's Arnold Schwarzenegger.
- [CANDICE] Larry! - [LARRY GROANS] Who you calling? The police? That is a nice ring you got there, Larry.
Are you insane? I don't know.
Let's find out.
[GRUNTS] Okay, okay, okay.
Be cool, be cool.
I don't know his name, I swear.
- [SIGHS] - [SCREAMS] Ah, ah, ah! But you know him.
He He gives me things sometimes.
What kind of things? Money.
Presents.
Aah! Gifts.
Who is this guy, Santa Claus? Starcourt.
Starcourt.
He works for Starcourt.
- The mall? - Yes, yes.
Yeah, right.
Aah! I swear! I swear! I swear! Starcourt.
They They own the mall.
They want to expand to East Hawkins.
They needed property, some land.
Some people didn't want to sell, so I leaned on them a little.
That's all.
I swear, that's all.
[SIGHS, GROANS] [GROANS] - Why do they want this land? - I don't know! You have records of these purchases, these, uh these land purchases? [BREATHING RAPIDLY] You don't want to mess with these people, Jim.
I think you should worry about yourself right now, Larry, not about me.
The records.
Where are they? - [LARRY GROANS] - Larry? [HOPPER] He just bumped his head.
- Just a little boo-boo, right, Lar? - [GRUNTS] Have a nice day.
Larry! [NANCY] It's bullshit.
So, according to Tom, Driscoll's just a schizophrenic? And that rat is just a rat? And it's all, what, some big coincidence? You know what I think? I think Tom was on drugs.
- What? - Did you see him? He was sweating like crazy.
And his palms were clammy.
- He looked awful.
- [CHUCKLES] - Oh, is this funny to you? - No.
No, it's just kind of incredible.
Incredible? Yeah, incredible how you just continue to convince yourself.
What's that supposed to mean? I told you over and over to drop this story.
- That it was a bad idea.
- [SCOFFS] But you refused, and now, I'm screwed.
It's a summer job.
Your life is hardly over.
I don't live in a two-story house on Maple Street.
My dad doesn't earn six figures.
Hell, he isn't even around.
God, here comes the Oliver Twist routine.
Mortgage, college tuition.
You know, they're real things, Nancy.
Things that you don't care about, only because you don't have to.
- I didn't realize I lived in a bubble! - Well, you do! You want everything handed to you on a silver platter.
I mean, we were interns, Nancy! Interns! What did you expect, that you would make star reporter in a month? Crack the big case? You sound just like them.
You realize that, right? Just like Bruce and those assholes Yeah, yeah, those assholes gave us jobs.
Is that what that was? That was humiliating.
Humiliating.
Yeah, the real world sucks.
Deal with it like the rest of us.
You don't know what it's like.
Neither do you.
[SCOFFS] Well, then, I guess we just don't understand each other anymore.
Yeah, I guess not.
Hey, you're home early.
Yeah.
Light day.
[NANCY SNIFFLES] [ROBIN] It is fascinating what 20 bucks will get you at the County Recorder's Office.
Starcourt Mall.
The complete blueprints.
Not bad.
So, this is us, Scoops, and this is where we want to get.
I mean, I don't really see a way in.
There's not, if you're talking exclusively about doors.
Air ducts.
Exactly.
Turns out, this secret room needs air just like any old room.
And these air ducts lead all the way here.
Flashlight.
Thank you.
Yeah, I don't know, man.
I don't know if you can fit in here.
It's, like super tight.
I'll fit.
Trust me.
No collar bones, remember? Uh, excuse me? Oh, he's, uh Yeah, he's got some disease.
Chry, uh It's chrydo, um Something.
Yeah, I dunno.
He's missing bones and stuff.
He can bend like Gumbo.
You mean Gumby.
I'm pretty sure it's Gumbo.
- Steve, just shut up and push me! - Okay.
I'll push ya.
- Not my feet, dumbass.
Push my ass.
- [STEVE] What? Touch my butt! I don't care! - Come on! Harder! Push harder! - I'm pushing! You're playing with my legs.
I'm not playing, I have terrible footing.
- Come on! - I'm gonna just shove you, ready? - [DUSTIN] Just shove me? - One, two - Shit.
- [STEVE] That work? - [DUSTIN] One more time.
- Ahoy, sailors! All hands on deck! Ahoy! - [BELL DINGING] - [ERICA] Come on.
Get over here and serve me some samples.
I don't know.
He looks pretty normal to me.
Normal? How many times have you seen him with a shirt on? I mean, it's a little weird.
More than a little.
He was in a tub with ice.
The Mind Flayer likes it cold.
- Plus everything else - But he's lounging at the pool, which is, like, the least Mind Flayer thing ever.
Not necessarily.
The Mind Flayer likes to hide.
He only used me when he needed me.
It's like like you're dormant.
And then, when he needs you, you're activated.
Okay, so we just wait until he gets activated.
No.
What if he hurts someone? Or kills someone.
We can't take that chance.
We need to find out if he's the host.
- Where are you going? - I have an idea.
Boys only.
- Seriously? - Just trust me on this one.
Okay, so we wait until the pool closes, until everyone leaves, and we somehow get him to come from here and get him into here.
- Hey, shut the door! - [MAN] Hey, come on, kid, shut it! I think I just threw up in my mouth.
And look, the controls are right here.
It's perfect.
- Will it get hot enough? - 220 degrees.
We just have to figure out how to get him in here.
- Then we lock him in - Heat him up No matter what happens, we'll know.
We'll know for sure.
Hmm - Yeah, I don't know.
- You don't know if you can fit? Oh, I can fit.
I just don't know if I want to.
Are you claustrophobic? [SNICKERS] I don't have phobias.
- Okay, well, what's the problem? - The problem is, I still haven't heard what's in this for Erica.
[NAUTICAL TUNE PLAYING] More fudge, please.
Go on.
[ROBIN] All right.
You see this? This is the route you're gonna take.
Then we just wait till the last delivery goes out tonight.
Then you knock out the grate, jump down, open the door.
- Then you find out what's in those boxes? - Exactly.
[ERICA] Mm-hmm.
And you say this guard is armed.
Yes, but he won't be there.
- And booby traps? - Booby traps? - Lasers, spikes in the wall? - What? You know what this half-baked plan of yours sounds like to me? Child endangerment.
We'll be in radio contact with you the whole time Ah, ah, ah! Child endangerment.
Erica? Hi.
Uh We think these Russians want to do harm to our country.
Great harm.
Don't you love your country? You can't spell "America" without "Erica".
[SLURPING LOUDLY] Uh, yeah, yeah.
Oddly, that's, uh, totally true.
So, so, don't do this for us.
Do it for your country.
Do it for your fellow man.
- [SLURPING CONTINUES] - Do this for America Erica.
Ooh! I just got the chills.
Oh, yeah, from this float, not your speech.
Know what I love most about this country? Capitalism.
- Do you know what capitalism is? - Yeah.
- Yeah.
- It means this is a free market system.
Which means people get paid for their services, depending on how valuable their contributions are.
And it seems to me, my ability to fit into that little vent is very, very valuable to you all.
So, you want my help? This USS Butterscotch better be the first of many.
And I'm talking free ice cream for life.
[HOPPER WHISTLES] Wow, I love the place, Lar.
Hey, you shoot that fella yourself? [LARRY WINCES] That's That's not real.
No shit! All right, so what exactly are we looking at? Land deeds, transfers of property.
So your buddies at Starcourt, they suddenly start buying up all this property.
- They tell you why? - I already told you, they don't tell me anything.
They're just using you, I get it.
What I don't get is why you have a bunch of land deeds in a safe in your bedroom.
These people, Jim, they're bad news.
So, what, this is blackmail? - Protection.
- Protection.
Hold on a second.
Hey, what is it? Hess Farm, Henry's place, Bullocks Look, they're all here.
They're all in Southeast Hawkins, right near Jordan Lake.
And what else is near Jordan Lake? The power plant.
Four nights ago, there was a huge power outage, - and the next day - Your magnets fell.
Yeah, I mean, Scott says that this machine would take a massive amount of power to run.
- Yeah.
- So, what if this machine that we've been talking about really does exist, and the reason that we didn't find it at the lab is because it isn't at the lab, it's at one of these properties.
Um I want you to forget about sales.
I want you to come work for me at the Hawkins PD.
And have to look at your face every day? I don't think so.
[CLATTERING] Larry! Hey! Hey, where do you think you're going, pal? [LARRY SCREAMS] - [KNOCKING] - [KAREN] Nancy? Nance? [SNIFFLES] [NANCY] Maybe Jonathan's right.
To be honest, I wasn't thinking about him.
I wasn't thinking about anyone, really.
I just I wanted to be right.
- I wanted to be right so badly.
- And were you? I thought so.
But maybe I just don't want to admit that I'm wrong, because if I'm wrong, then You're what everyone thinks you are.
Just a kid who has no idea what she's doing.
[SIGHS] It's not easy out there, Nance.
I know.
People are always saying you can't.
That you shouldn't.
That you're not smart enough, not good enough.
[SIGHS] This world, it it beats you up again and again until eventually, I Most people, they just they just stop trying.
But you're not like that.
You're a fighter.
You always have been.
I honestly don't know where you get it from.
[CHUCKLES] Dad.
[BOTH LAUGH] I think you were swapped in the hospital, to tell you the truth.
No.
I get it from you, Mom.
I get it from you.
Well, wherever you get it from, I'm proud of you.
Proud of me for getting fired? That you stood up for yourself.
That you stood up to those shitheads.
Mom! Yes, those shitheads.
[CHUCKLES, SNIFFLES] And if you believe in this story Look at me, Nancy.
finish it.
Then go sell it to The Indianapolis Star or whatever and I mean, can you imagine their faces when they read a story about their own town in a big paper like that? That would be pretty amazing.
So, why not? Why not? Finish it.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [LIGHTER CLICKS] Uh, Will? Um, you know, about yesterday It's fine, Lucas.
You don't have to say anything.
I know, but it's just It was a really cool campaign.
- And Mike and I, we should've never - I don't care anymore, Lucas.
I really don't.
We have bigger things to worry about now.
This should hold him.

He made me lie.

What if he's right? - What? - Hop.
No, no, no, no.
He's just some angry old man who hates joy.
But if I only see you, and I'm a different species than you, then I should be with my species more.
