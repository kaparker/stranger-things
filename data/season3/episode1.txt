- They like you no matter what you do.
- Hey, they like you too.
Yeah.
They like that I'm a coffee delivery machine.
They don't actually like me or respect me as a living, breathing human with a brain.
Wait, you just you just gotta be patient, okay? They're set in their ways, you know? But once they realize what a gifted writer you are, they'll come around.
I really don't need a Jonathan Byers pep talk right now.
Can you just please drive faster? Okay.

You busy? You're our first customer, so [SCOFFS] What now? And then El, she just slams the door.
Right in my face.
Uh-huh? You know, it is that smug son of a bitch, Mike.
He's corrupting her, I'm telling you.
And I'm just gonna lose it.
I mean, I am gonna lose it, Joyce.
Just take it down, Hopper.
I need for them to break up.
That is not your decision.
They're spending entirely too much time together.
You agree with me about that, right? Well, I mean, they're just kissing, right? Yeah, but it is constant.
It is constant.
Okay? That is not normal, that is not healthy.
You can't just force them apart.
I mean, they're not little kids anymore, Hop.
They're teenagers.
If you order them around like a cop, then they're gonna rebel.
It's just what they do.
So what, I'm just supposed to let them do whatever they want? No, I didn't say that.
I think you should talk to them.
No.
No.
'Cause talking doesn't work.
Not yelling.
Not ordering.
But talk to them.
You know, like a heart-to-heart.
A heart-to-heart? What is that? You sit them down and you talk to them, like you're their friend.
I find if you talk to them like you're on their level, then they really start to listen.
And then, you know, you could start to create some boundaries.
- Boundaries.
- Yeah, but, Hop, it's really important that no matter how they respond, you stay calm.
You cannot lose your temper.
Uh Maybe you could do it for me? No.
Yeah, you could.
Yeah, you could.
You come over after work.
- Yes.
- No.
It only works if it comes from you.
But - But? - Maybe I can help you find the right words.
["WORKIN' FOR A LIVIN'" PLAYING] Ooh, whoa! Some days won't end ever and some days pass on by I'll be workin' here forever - Thanks, hon.

I need something real.
Oh, I think they're real.
[MEN LAUGHING] What about Starcourt? I I was just thinking I mean, I know everyone loves the mall, but how many small businesses have closed since it opened? Like, five on Main, at least.
It's changing the fabric of our town - in a way - "The Death of Small-Town America".
I like it.
I like it a lot.
But I think I've got something even spicier.
It's about the missing mustard on my hamburger.
[MEN LAUGHING] You think you can follow the clues and solve the case of the missing condiment, Nancy Drew? Sorry.
Look out, Phil, she might be after your job! Ow, ow, ow.
Ow.

[GIRLS CHUCKLE] Yeah, you know, I considered it, Purdue, but then I was like, you know what? I really think I need some real-life experience, you know, before I hit college, see what it feels like.
Kinda like, uh, I don't know, see what it's like to earn a working-man's wage, you know? Uh - [REGISTER BEEPING] - Oh, I'm sorry.

I am telling you, it is totally blowing my best feature.
Yeah, company policy is a real drag.
You know, it's a crazy idea, but have you considered telling the truth? Oh, you mean, that I couldn't even get into Tech and my douchebag dad's trying to teach me a lesson, I make three bucks an hour, and I have no future? That truth? Hey, twelve o'clock.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Okay Uh I'm going in.
Okay? And you know what? - Screw company policy.
- Oh, my God, you're a whole new man.
Right? Ooh.
[CHUCKLES] - Ahoy, ladies! Didn't see you there.

You know, I'm pretty sure people in Utah have telephones.
Yeah, but Suzie's Mormon.
Oh, shit.
She doesn't have electricity? Oh, that's the Amish.
- [WILL] What are Mormons? - Super religious white people.
They have electricity and cars and stuff, but since I'm not Mormon, her parents would never approve.
It's all a bit Shakespearean.
Shakespearean? Yeah.
Like Romeo and Juliet.
Right.
