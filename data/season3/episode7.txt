That it was all for me.
Building something - Is he talking about the flayed? - He must be.
So, he's building an army, just like we thought.
Yeah, but he's not building this army to spread.
He's building it to stop Eleven.
Last year, El closed the gate on him.
I have a feeling that really pissed him off.
Like, royally.
And the Mind Flayer now knows that she's the only thing that can stop him.
- But if she's out of the way - Game over.
He also said he was gonna kill all of you.
Yeah, well, that's nice.
[FAINT SCREECHING NOISE] [OMINOUS SYNTH MUSIC PLAYING] [FAINT SCREECHING NOISE] Do you guys hear that? [NANCY SHUDDERS] It's just the fireworks.

- One sec, one sec.
Steve, Steve.
- [STEVE] God, no.
Ow! His pupils are super dilated.
Maybe he's drugged.
Ugh.
Boop! Steve, are you drugged? How many times, Dad? I don't do drugs.
It's only marijuana.
This isn't funny, okay? I need to know what they did to you.
- Are you gonna die on us? - Boop.
We all die, my strange little child friend.
It's just a matter of how and when.
They're gonna be looking for us up there, so I need you to tell me where you parked your car.
Oh, can we make a pit stop at the food court? - I would kill for a hot dog on a stick.
- Ooh! All right.
Yeah, food.
Yes, you can have as much food as you want, but only if you tell me where your car is parked.
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh? The car's off the board.
- What? - They took the keys.
The Russians, they took the keys.
Like, forever ago.
[ROBIN AND STEVE LAUGH] That's a bummer, right? [ROBIN LAUGHING] [ROBIN AND STEVE] Oh! Oh, my God, that tastes so good.
Ah! Steve, can you taste the air? I taste it! I taste it! - Stop! - Shit! Come on! Come on! - [KIDS CLAMORING] - [IN RUSSIAN] Stop right there! - [ROBIN] Okay, okay, okay! Woo! - Why are we running? [ROBIN LAUGHING] [ELEVEN GRUNTING] [MIKE] Yeah.

[SCORE FROM BACK TO THE FUTURE PLAYING] [MARTY] Doc! What did I tell you?! Eighty-eight miles per hour! [DUSTIN] Come on.
- [METAL CLANGING IN MOVIE] - [DOC GASPS] [DOC] The temporal displacement occurred exactly 1:20 - You two, sit.
- No, no, no! These seats are too close! - Dude, these seats blow.
- Then don't watch the movie.
- We wanna watch it.
- Then watch it! - Shh! - Shh! Sorry.
Whatever you do, don't go anywhere.
- Fine, Dad.
- [ROBIN SNICKERS] [DOC] The appropriate question is "When the hell are they?" You see, Einstein has just become - the world's first time traveler! - Sorry.
Sorry.
- [DOC] I sent him into the future! - [DUSTIN SIGHS] Okay, it's official.
I'm never having kids.
- What are we doing here? - We're laying low.
Cooling off.
Like Oswald.
Oswald was found in a theater and shot to death.
A week later.
The point is, his plan didn't work.
Only because it was a setup.
- What? - He was just a patsy.
- Tell me you're joking.
- Shh! [ERICA AND DUSTIN] Shh! We need to get outta here.
All right, you watch Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
- Make sure they don't go anywhere.
- Where are you going? To find us a ride.
[DOC] Look out! [DELOREAN ZAPPING] [BRAKES SCREECHING] [MARTY] Doc - What's happening? - I have no idea.
[MARTY] Are you telling me that you built a time machine [ALEXEI SPEAKING RUSSIAN] - What's he saying? - He's showing me the location of the key to turn off the machine.
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN] - Sorry, "keys".
Two keys.
- [ALEXEI SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Two-man rule.
- Two-man rule? - Yeah, two men, two keys, like a nuclear launch.
But, uh, to retrieve the keys, there is a vault.
- [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] - And to open the vault, you need to enter Planck's constant.
- Planck's what? - Planck's constant.
- It's a very famous number.
- All right, so we get the keys, and then we turn the machine off.
That's what he says.
All right, well, that shouldn't be too hard.
We can do this.
Joyce, did you hear the part where he said the place was like an impenetrable fortress? Yeah, but there has to be a way in.
Yeah, there is.
Our military.
- Who are coming.
- Well, we don't know that anymore because you yelled at them like it was a parent-teacher conference, and then you hung up on them, so we don't know what the hell's going on, because now we're Wait, wait, what are we do Oh! Wait, that's right! We're on our way to rescue our children from the big, bad Fourth of July celebration! You know what, if you can't handle this, then just turn around and drop me off first.
What are you gonna do? You gonna walk back to Hawkins? I will do anything if it gets me away from you! Children! Children! Children! This interminable bickering was amusing at first, but it's getting very stale and we've still got a long drive ahead of us.
So, why don't you two cut the horseshit and get to the part where you admit your sexual feelings for one another? - Whoa! - You are way off base, buddy! Oh, spare me, spare me, spare me! Yes, yes, he's a brute.
I know.
Probably reminds you of a bad relationship, and, gosh, you'd really like a nice man to settle down with, but, admit it, you're real curious to know what he's like in the sack.
And you.
Ha! Well, you're just a big manbaby who'd rather act tough than show his true feelings, because the last time you opened your heart, you got hurt.
Owie.
And now, rather than admit these feelings, you're dancing around one another with this mind-numbing and frankly boorish mating ritual.
So, please, for my sake, either quit your bickering, or pull over, tear off those clothes, and get it over with already! [GASPS] [DEEP SIGH] [IN RUSSIAN] What was that? [IN RUSSIAN] I told them they should have sex.
They have not had sex? No.
[SNICKERS] [CHUCKLES] [BOTH LAUGHING] [JOYCE MUTTERS] [ALEXEI SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [BOTH LAUGHING] [MURRAY LAUGHS] Oh! Oh! [MURRAY AND ALEXEI CONTINUE LAUGHING] [TIRES SQUEALING] [GLASS SHATTERING] [ELEVEN GROANS] Okay, get her down.
[NANCY] Okay.
Lemme see.
- Oh, shit.
- [GROANS] What What Hey, what are you doing? I'm cleaning the wound.
No, first, we need to stop the bleeding, then clean, then disinfect, then bandage.
I skateboard.
Trust me.
Mike, hold this.
[GROANS] Keep the pressure on it, nice and firm, okay? We're gonna need water, soap.
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.
Does any of this help? No.
Go get me a washcloth and a bowl.
- A bowl? - Lucas.
- Go.
- [STAMMERS] Okay.
[GROANS] [NANCY] What did that thing look like to you? Like that thing in the hospital, only bigger.
Yeah, a lot bigger.
Like, Tom and Bruce, they merged to become one, right? And And Driscoll kept saying how she needed to go back to the source Wait, you think Driscoll's in there? Maybe.
And And And maybe Heather and Janet, too, and God knows who else.
I don't know how we're gonna kill this thing, but if we do - We kill all the flayed.
- And we end this.
Maybe.
All I know is we need El.
[LUCAS] Bowl Bowl Bowl - Why wouldn't it be with the cereal? - I don't know.
What else do you use a bowl for? I I don't know.
[LUCAS SIGHS] Oh, shit.
Satan's Baby.
You ever shot one of these suckers? No.
Is it sweet? - That's an understatement.
- [MAX] That doesn't look like a bowl.
Nah, it's way better.
There is a reason this warning label says "18 or older".
This sucker is filled with 150 grains of black powder.
AKA gunpowder.
Strap two of these together, and it's bigger than an M-80.
Five of them, we've got ourselves a stick of dynamite.
You wanna kill that thing with fireworks? Do you have a better idea? Uh, yeah.
Eleven.
Against that thing? She's gonna need some backup.
- Oh, my God.
- [LUCAS SCOFFS] Hold this.
[MIKE GROANS] Does that hurt? Uh, not bad.
You're gonna have an awesome scar.
You'll look even more badass.
Bitchin'.
Yeah, bitchin'.
[CHUCKLES] El Yeah? I've been meaning to tell you something.
It's just, being broken up, it's been hard.
[DISTORTED RADIO CHATTER] And I like that you and Max are friends now.
It's just, I was jealous at first, and and angry.
And that's why I said all that stupid stuff.
And it's like I wanted you all to myself.
And now I realize how unfair that is.
And selfish.
And, like I'm sorry.
I just, like, I've never felt like this, you know, with anyone before and [SIGHS] You know, they do say it makes you crazy.
What makes you crazy? You never You never heard that term You know, like the phrase, like "blank makes you crazy", like the word - "Girlfriends"? - No, no, no, no, not not girlfriends.
- "Boyfriends".
- No! No, no, not boyfriends either.
- It's like It's like a feeling or - [SOFTLY] A feeling Yeah, like something Like, old people say it to each other sometimes.
- Old people? - Yeah.
What I wanna say is that I just I know that I - [DUSTIN SPEAKING VIA RADIO, GARBLED] - [STATIC POPPING] [DUSTIN, DISTORTED VIA RADIO] I repeat this is a code red! - [SCORE FROM BACK TO THE FUTURE PLAYS] - Dustin? Mike? - [MIKE] Dustin! - Mike! Oh, my God, you have to listen.
I know I've been MIA, and I'm sorry, it's not because I'm mad.
I mean, I actually was mad, but it's also because I was trapped underground in a secret Russian base.
[GARBLED RADIO AUDIO] Dustin, you're going way too fast.
I can't understand you.
I know that sounds insane, but the Russians have infiltrated Hawkins! The goddamn Russians! And now they're using to open the gate.
Dustin, you're you're breaking up.
And now they're after us and we don't have a way out of here, so I need you to come and get us.
Can Nancy drive? [GARBLED RADIO AUDIO] Dustin, you're cutting out.
- Mike? - Dustin, you there? Mike? Mike, do you copy? Dustin [POWERING DOWN NOISE] Shit! Not now.
Please, not now.
Mike! - Dustin! - Mike! [STATIC HISSING] What is it? Do you have any batteries? Double-A? Why would I have batteries? I always carry batteries.
Then what's the problem? I need eight.
Eight? Shit.
Guess we'll have to go to plan B.
Plan B? What's plan B? [FILM SCORE CRESCENDOS] Where are they? That's amazing.
So, like, I wasn't totally focused in there or anything, but I'm pretty sure that mom was trying to bang her son.
Wait, wait, the hot chick was Alex P.
Keaton's mom? Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
But they're the same age.
No, but he went back in time.
[SNICKERS] Then why is it called Back to the Future? He has to go back to the future because he's in the past.
So, the future is actually the present, which is his time.
Wh What? No, no, it's my turn.
You've had enough.
[ROBIN GRUNTS CONTENTEDLY] [GENTLE SYNTH MUSIC PLAYING] [ECHOING] Wow.

I'm sorry about him, by the way.
- Who, Larry? - No, Murray.
He's a sick individual who likes to get under people's skin.
So, let's not let him, you know, get under our skin.
I'm not, I haven't.
I just, you seem a little more quiet than usual.
- I just I just wanna find the kids.

- [WHISPERS] Oh, sorry.
- How do you even drink that? - Because it's delicious.
[MIKE AND MAX] What? It's like Carpenter's The Thing.
The original is a classic, no question about it.
But the remake [SLURPING LOUDLY] [SATISFIED SIGH] [SMACKING LIPS] Sweeter, bolder better.
You're insane.
So, you prefer the original Thing? What? No, I'm not talking about The Thing, I'm talking about New Coke.
It's the same concept, dude.
Uh, actually, it's not the same concept.
It is the same concept.
- No, it's not.
- [YELLS] Yes, it is.
Hey.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Did you find him? [LUCAS] The movies? Dustin's so freaked out about the gate, he decides to go watch a movie? Yeah, makes total sense.
You're positive he said "gate" and not "great"? Yeah, like, "This movie I'm watching is great.
" Sounded like "gate".
Which would explain how the Mind Flayer's still alive.
- Yeah, we just have to shut it again.
- Then the monster dies.
But if not, we always have Lucas' fireworks.
Keep mocking my plan, Max.
Keep mocking it.
I wanna hear you say it again, because you keep doubting me.
You keep doubting me! - [MAX] Ridiculous.
- [LUCAS] Will? We're gonna prove 'em wrong, right? [EERIE SYNTH MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREECHING] [STEVE GROANS] The ceiling stopped spinning for me.
Is it still spinning for you? Holy shit.
No.
You think we puked it all up? Maybe.
Ask me something.
[IN RUSSIAN ACCENT] Interrogate me.
Okay.
Interrogate you.
Sure.
Um When was the last time you, uh, peed your pants? Today.
What? When the Russian doctor took out the bone saw.
[LAUGHS] Oh, my God.
It was just a little bit, though.
Yeah, it's definitely still in her system.
[LAUGHS] [GROANS] [ROBIN] Oh - All right, my turn.
- Okay.
Hit me.
Have you ever been in love? Yep.
Nancy Wheeler.
First semester, senior year.
[IMITATES GUNSHOT, CHUCKLES] Oh, my God.
She's such a priss.
[STEVE] Hm.
Turns out, not really.
[SCOFFS] Are you still in love with Nancy? - No.
- Why not? I think it's because I found someone who's a little bit better for me.
[CHUCKLES] It's crazy.
Ever since Dustin got home, he's been saying, "You know, you gotta find your Suzie.
You gotta find your Suzie.
" Wait, who's Suzie? It's some girl from camp, I guess his girlfriend.
To be honest with you, I'm not 100% sure she's even real.
But that's not that's not really the point.
That doesn't matter.
The point is, this girl, you know, the one that I like, it's somebody that I didn't even talk to in school.
And I don't even know why.
Maybe 'cause Tommy H.
would've made fun of me or I wouldn't be prom king.
It's stupid.
I mean, Dustin's right, it's all just a bunch of bullshit anyways.
Because, when I think about it, I should've been hanging out with this girl the whole time.
First of all, she's hilarious.
She's so funny.
I feel like, this summer, I have laughed harder than I have laughed in a really long time.
And she's smart.
Way smarter than me.
You know, she can crack, like, top secret Russian codes and You know? She's honestly unlike anyone I've ever even met before.
Robin? [TAPPING ON STALL] Robin, did you just OD in there? No.
[SIGHS] I am still alive.
[DEEP SIGH] [ROBIN] The floor's disgusting.
Yeah, well, I already got a bunch of blood and puke on my shirt, so What do you think? About? This girl.
She sounds awesome.
She is awesome.
And what about the guy? I think he's on drugs, and he's not thinking straight.
Really? 'Cause I think he's thinking a lot more clearly than usual.
He's not.
Look he doesn't even know this girl.
And if he did know her, like like really know her, I don't think he'd even want to be her friend.
No, that's not true.
No way is that true.
Listen to me, Steve.
It's shocked me to my core, but I like you.
I really like you.
But I'm not like your other friends.
And I'm not like Nancy Wheeler.
Robin, that's exactly why I like you.
[ROBIN SCOFFS] Do you remember what I said about Click's class? About me being jealous and, like, obsessed? Yeah.
It isn't because I had a crush on you.
It's because she wouldn't stop staring at you.
Mrs.
Click? [CHUCKLES] Tammy Thompson.
I wanted her to look at me.
But she couldn't pull her eyes away from you and your stupid hair.
And I didn't understand, because you would get bagel crumbs all over the floor.
And you asked dumb questions.
And you were a douchebag.
And And you didn't even like her and I would go home and just scream into my pillow.
But Tammy Thompson's a girl.
[SOFTLY] Steve.
Yeah? Oh.
Oh.
Holy shit.
Yeah.
Holy shit.
Steve did you OD over there? No, I just, uh just thinking.
Okay.
I mean, yeah.
Tammy Thompson, you know, she's cute and all, but I mean, she's a total dud.
She is not.
Yes, she is.
She wants to be, like, a singer.
She wants to move to, like, Nashville and shit.
- She has dreams.
- She can't even hold a tune.
She's practically tone-deaf.
Have you heard her? - [ROBIN CHUCKLES] - All the time.
[SINGING ATONALLY] You see me now tonight - Shut up.
- You see me - She does not sound like that.
- She sounds exactly - That's a great impersonation of her.
- She does not.
You sound like a Muppet.
She sounds like a Muppet.
She sounds like a Muppet giving birth.
[BOTH LAUGHING] [SINGS LIKE KERMIT] And if you could hold me tight [BOTH SING ATONALLY] We'll be holding on forever - Exactly.
- [LAUGHS] I know! Okay.
What the hell? [BOTH LAUGH] [INTENSE SYNTH MUSIC PLAYING] [CREATURE SHRIEKS WEAKLY] [MONSTROUS SCREECHING] [CHEERING AND LAUGHING] [ALEXEI, IN RUSSIAN] And why all this? If I just turn the keys, it's like turning off a car.
But then the car still works, does it not? [IN RUSSIAN] Yes.
And do you want the car to still work or do you want it to explode? I want the car to explode.
Good.
Then do this.
Just make sure you are nowhere near it when it does.
It is not pretty.
Turns people into dust.
And then It's over.
[CHUCKLES] And I become an American citizen and join in the fun, yes? Who said you had to be an American to join the fun? [CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD CHEERING] [IN RUSSIAN] It doesn't get more American than this, my friend.
Fatty foods, ugly decadence, rigged games [CHEERING] - They are rigged, these games? - [IN RUSSIAN] Yes.
[BALLOON POPS] They do not look rigged.
That's just it, my dear Alexei.
They have been designed to present the illusion of fairness! But it's all a scam, a trick, to put your money in the rich man's pocket.
That, my dear friend, is America.
But, hey knock yourself out.
