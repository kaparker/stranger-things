Wait, you just you just gotta be patient, okay? They're set in their ways, you know? But once they realize what a gifted writer you are, they'll come around.

He's corrupting her, I'm telling you.
And I'm just gonna lose it.
I mean, I am gonna lose it, Joyce.
Just take it down, Hopper.
I need for them to break up.
That is not your decision.
They're spending entirely too much time together.
You agree with me about that, right? Well, I mean, they're just kissing, right? Yeah, but it is constant.
It is constant.
Okay? That is not normal, that is not healthy.
You can't just force them apart.
I mean, they're not little kids anymore, Hop.
They're teenagers.
If you order them around like a cop, then they're gonna rebel.
It's just what they do.
So what, I'm just supposed to let them do whatever they want? No, I didn't say that.
I think you should talk to them.
No.
No.
'Cause talking doesn't work.
Not yelling.
Not ordering.
But talk to them.
You know, like a heart-to-heart.
A heart-to-heart? What is that? You sit them down and you talk to them, like you're their friend.
I find if you talk to them like you're on their level, then they really start to listen.
And then, you know, you could start to create some boundaries.
- Boundaries.
- Yeah, but, Hop, it's really important that no matter how they respond, you stay calm.
You cannot lose your temper.
Uh Maybe you could do it for me? No.
Yeah, you could.
Yeah, you could.
You come over after work.
- Yes.
- No.
It only works if it comes from you.
But - But? - Maybe I can help you find the right words.

[MEN SNICKER] [BRUCE] Pouring coffee's a tough gig, girl.
[MEN LAUGH] [KNOCKING] And here you are, two creams, two sugars.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Of course.
- Tom? - Hm? I really hate to ask this, but do you think one of the other girls could run and grab lunch today? They're needed at their desks.
I know, I just, um I really need to go to the doctor.
I've been having some um girl problems.
[COUGHS NERVOUSLY] - Oh, come on! The light! - Let's go.
Look, I just I just don't know if this is such a good idea anymore.
Really? Because I feel like it's the best idea I've had all summer.
Look, all I'm saying is, what harm is there in asking? The harm in asking is that Tom will say no.
We ask for forgiveness, not permission.
And if this story's as good as I think it's gonna be, then Tom won't care.
In fact, he'll thank us.
Or the old lady is nuts and the story blows up in our face and Tom fires us.
And then we never have to work at this shithole again.
["GET UP AND GO" PLAYING] Go, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh So get up and go If you're so tired of moving slow Go Go Get up and go! - Have a nice day.

Proud of you, man.
That's ro That's kinda romantic.
- That's like Wow.
- Hm.
So do you really just get to eat as much of this as you want? Yeah.
I mean, sure.
It's not really a good idea for me, though.
I gotta keep in shape for the ladies.
Yeah, and how's that working out for you? - Ignore her.
- She seems cool.
She's not.
So, where are the other knuckleheads? They ditched me yesterday.
- No.
- My first day back.
- Can you believe that shit? - Whoa.
Seriously? I swear to God.
Mm.
They're gonna regret it, though, big time, when they don't get to share in my glory.

And then he just hung up.
- He's a piece of shit.
- What? Mike doesn't have jack shit to do today, and his Nana obviously isn't sick.
I guarantee you, him and Lucas are playing Atari right now.
But friends don't lie.
Yeah, well, boyfriends lie.
All the time.
She knows I'm lying.
She knows I'm lying.
- I don't even understand.
Why lie? - Hopper.
He threatened me.
- Did he say he'd kill you? - What? No.
- So then, what's the big deal? - The big deal is if I don't do what he says, then he'll stop me from seeing El.
Like, permanently.
- You don't understand, Lucas.
He's crazy.
- [SIGHS] He's lost his mind.
Hey, guys, I'm almost set up here.
I had no choice, Lucas.
I really had no choice.
I just wish you'd consulted me, because the way you handled this, you're in deep shit.
You're going to stop calling him.
You're going to ignore his calls.
As far as you're concerned, he doesn't exist.
Doesn't exist? He treated you like garbage.
You're gonna treat him like garbage.
Give him a taste of his own medicine.
Give him the medicine.
Mm-hmm.
And if he doesn't fix this, if he doesn't explain himself, dump his ass.
[GROANS] I'm not gonna lie, it's gonna be bad.
[GROANS] But you can fix this.
It's just one little mistake.
I've made hundreds, thousands.
Max has dumped me five times.

I've marched back into battle, and I've won her back every single freaking time.

- What? The music.
The music right there at the end.
Why are you listening to the music, Steve? Listen to the Russian! - We're translating Russian! - I'm trying to listen to the Russian, - but there's music - All right, babysitting time is over.
You need to get in there.
Hey, my board.
That was important data, shitbirds.
I guarantee you, what we're doing is way more important than your data.
Yeah? And how do you know these Russians are up to no good anyways? - How does she know about the Russians? - I don't know.
- You told her about - It wasn't me.
Hello, I can hear you.
Actually, I can hear everything.
You are both extremely loud.
You think you have evil Russians plotting against our country, on tape, and you're trying to translate, but haven't figured out a word because you didn't realize Russians use an entirely different alphabet than you do.
Sound about right? - Whoa! What do you think you're doing? - I wanna hear it.
- [BOTH] Why? - 'Cause maybe I can help.
- I'm fluent in four languages, you know.
- Russian? Ou-yay are-yay umb-day.
[LAUGHS] Oh-ho-ho! Holy shit! That was Pig Latin, dingus.
- Idiot.
- But I can speak Spanish and French and Italian, and I've been in band for 12 years.
- My ears are little geniuses, trust me.
- Uh Come on, it's your turn to sling ice cream, my turn to translate.
I don't even want credit.
I'm just bored.
[BELL DINGS AT COUNTER] [LIGHT JAZZ PLAYING] Yes? - Mrs.
Driscoll? - Yes? Hi, um, I'm Nancy.
Nancy Wheeler.
We spoke briefly on the phone last night.
We're from The Hawkins Post.
Oh! Oh, yes! Oh, my goodness.
Oh.
You look too young for reporters.
- We get that a lot.
- [MRS.
DRISCOLL CHUCKLES] Follow me.
[NANCY] Oh, it's it's lovely.
Um, do you live here all alone? Yes.
Jack, my husband, he passed away, what is it now, ten years ago.
Oh, um I'm I'm so sorry.
Oh, don't be.
I kinda like the quiet.
At least, I did.
[DOOR HINGE CREAKS] This way.
[STEPS CREAKING] It's right over there.
[MRS.
DRISCOLL] You see those little teeth marks, don't ya? And these bags, um you're sure they were full before? I'm old, honey, not senile.
Bought them over at Blackburn's Supplies just last Tuesday.
Now you tell me, why would rats want to eat a poor old woman's fertilizer? Are you sure they did? Maybe they just gnawed the bag? I mean eating fertilizer seems Crazy.
Believe me, I know, honey.
But [SIGHS] something's not right with these rats.
What does that mean, exactly "not right"? Rabies, my guess.
That's when I said to myself, "Doris, you gotta call the paper.
" Because if those diseased rats are runnin' loose, the people, they oughta know.
" Wouldn't you agree? [CRASHING SOUND] Oh, yes, I forgot to mention! Come on over here.
- [THUD] - [LOUD SQUEAL] I caught one of the little bastards.

[CHUCKLES] Thanks for coming by.
I'm not doing it, Larry.
[LAUGHS] Calm down, now.
You don't even know what I want.
You don't like your fan club, you want me to shut 'em down.
Sound about right? [LAUGHS] When'd you get so serious? Take a seat.
- [PROTESTERS CHEERING] - [PROTESTER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [CLEARS THROAT DRAMATICALLY] [GRUNTS] My fan club, as you call them, now, you know why they're out there, don't ya? They're not actually fans? [CHUCKLES] They lost their jobs to the mall and blame me for helping make that happen.
Now, you go ask anyone else in this town.
They all love the mall.
It's helped our economy grow, brought in new jobs, and just some incredible new stores.
Which is why they all stopped shopping at their, uh, mom-and-pops.
Now, that's not me, Jim.
- Mm-hmm? - Uh-uh.
That's just, uh, good old fashioned American capitalism.
Well, Larry, I think that they're just exercising their good old fashioned American right to protest.
- [GRUNTS] - I agree.
- Yeah.
- If.
If they had a permit.
Now, correct me if I'm wrong here, Jim, but, uh I don't believe they secured a permit from your office, did they? Not that I'm aware of.
Then I do believe it's within my right to get rid of them.
Larry, I'm not a politics guy, but I think if you force those people out of here without provocation, I don't think that's a good look for your re-election campaign.
["AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL" PLAYING] You know what's in four days, Jim? Independence Day? That's right.
And I'm gonna throw this town the biggest bash it's ever seen.
Fireworks, music, activities, you name it.

You know why? 'Cause at the end of the day, that's all the voters will remember.
But I can't think, much less plan, with all that racket going on out there.

Against the rules.
Seriously? You have superpowers.
What's the worst that could happen? [UPBEAT SYNTH MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] So, what should we do first? [LAUGHS] You've never been shopping before, have you? Well, then I guess we're just gonna have to try everything.
Ooh.
Come on.
I just I don't understand what we're looking for.
Something pretty and shiny that says "I'm sorry".
What, just something that literally says "I'm sorry"? No! [CASH REGISTER BEEPING] Do you like that? How do I know what I like? You just try things on.

- Shall we? - Yeah.
[ELECTRIC HUM] I I don't see anything.
Nope.
You can't see it, but it's there, I assure you.
Our very own Clarke-Byers Electromagnetic Field.
Pretty neato, huh? Yeah.
And this field affects any charged object in its vicinity.
- Just like my magnets.
- Just like your magnets.
Okay, why is nothing happening? Oh, because our field is stable.
But, if we reduce the current How The magnetic dipoles tried to orient according to the field, but No, no, no, I mean, how is this happening at my house? You want my honest opinion? One of your kiddos got up in the middle of the night, bumped into the fridge, and knocked the suckers loose.
And the magnets at Melvald's? - Apophenia.
- Apo-what-o-whah? Apophenia.
Uh You're seeing patterns that aren't there.
Coincidence.
But what if it's not? Well Theoretically-speaking, I suppose some large version of this AC transformer could exist.
A machine of some kind.
A machine? But, in order to reach your house and downtown, gosh, that would take billions of volts of electricity and cost tens of millions of dollars.
But it is possible.
We cured polio in '53.
Landed on the moon in '69.
As I tell my students, once you open up that curiosity door, anything is possible.
[ROBIN, DUSTIN, AND STEVE] "The week is long", the silver cat feeds, "when blue meets yellow in the west".
I mean, it just it just can't be right.
- [ROBIN] It's right.
- Honestly, I think it's great news.
How is this great news? [CHUCKLES] I mean, so much for being American heroes.
- It's total nonsense.
- It's not nonsense.
It's too specific.
It's obviously a code.
- What do you mean, a code? - Like a super secret spy code.
- That's a total stretch.
- [ROBIN] I don't know, is it? You're buying into this? Listen, just for kicks, let's entertain the possibility that it is a secret Russian transmission.
What'd you think they were gonna say, "Fire the warhead at noon"? - Exactly.
- And my translation is correct.
I know that for sure, so "The silver cat feeds".
Why would anyone talk like that unless they're trying to mask - the meaning of their message? - Exactly.
Why would anyone mask the true meaning of their message unless the message was somehow sensitive? Exactly.
- So I guess that confirms your suspicion.
- Evil Russians.
I can't believe I'm about to agree with this strange child, but, yeah, totally evil Russians.
So how do we crack it? Well, I guess we translate the rest and hopefully a pattern emerges.
A pattern.
Right, like maybe "silver cat" is a meeting place? Or a person.
Or a weapon.
It's probably gonna take a super genius to crack it, but Where's Steve? - [ROBIN] Hey, Steve.
- [COINS CLATTER] What are you doing? Uh, it's a quarter.
I need Do you have a quarter? [CHUCKLES] - Sure you're tall enough for that ride? - Quarter! [WALTZ TUNE PLAYING] You need help getting up, little Stevie? - Shh! - [DUSTIN CHUCKLES] Would you two just shut up and listen? [WALTZ TUNE CONTINUES] Holy shit.
The music.
The music! - [MAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN] - [WALTZ TUNE PLAYING] I don't understand.
It's the exact same song on the recording.
Maybe they have horses like this in Russia.
"Indiana Flyer"? I don't I don't think so.

It came from here.

I'll just let you I'll leave you Holy shit, I can't believe we're really doing this.
- Ready? - Ready.
Mr.
Wheeler.
Ugh.
Boring.
Yeah, boring.
Spin again.
Against the rules? We make our own rules.
Billy.
Okay, look, I should just warn you, if he's with a girl or doing something gross, just get out of there right away before you're scarred for life.
- Max - No, I'm just saying, I'm serious.
- He's really gross.
- Max! Okay, shutting up now.
I found him.
What's he doing? I don't know.
Don't be afraid.
He's on the floor It'll be over soon.
talking to someone.
Just stay very still.
Billy! What is it? What happened? Yes! - What are you doing? - Yeah, Will, can you turn down the music? Please address me by my full name.
- What? - My full name! Oh, my God.
Okay, Will the Wise, can you please turn down the music? That is not music.
That is the sound of destiny! I have seen into the future, and I've seen that today is a new day, a day free of girls! What is happening right now? Will, come on.
A tribe of villagers are under threat from an evil force from the swamps of Kuzatan.
Will, it's so early.
Is it? Is it early, Michael? Tell that to the villagers crying for your help, the children so frightened, they cannot sleep.
Are you truly going to let them perish? Or are you going to come to their rescue and become the heroes you were always meant to be? Uh Can I at least take a shower first? Oh, God.
Hopper? Are you there? Oh! Look who it is! We need to talk.
Yeah, we do.
I haven't been stood up like that since Alice Gilbert in the 9th grade.
What are you doing? Joyce.
- Hello? - Just watch.
Okay, you're freaking me out.
- You slipped on this, remember? - Yeah.
Yeah, it fell in the night.
It lost its magnetism.
- Oh, did it? - And the same exact thing happened at my house the day before.
- Wow.
- And I thought, "Okay, that's weird.
" Right? Why are all these magnets suddenly losing their magnetism? - Uh-huh? - So, I went and saw Scott.
Scott.
Who's Scott? - Scott Clarke.
- Your child's science teacher? He's pretty brilliant, actually.
And I asked him, "How is this happening?" And he built this magnetic field using an AC transformer and plugging it into a solenoid.
And And with that solenoid, which basically Slow down, slow down.
I just want to get this exactly right, okay? You stand me up no phone call, no apology, because you had to go to Scott Clarke's house.
Yeah.
You've outdone yourself, Joyce.
You really have.
No, you've outdone yourself.
Oh, come on, Hop, you're not even listening to me.
Scott was able to demagnetize some of the magnets, and he thinks I don't care what Scott thinks! He thinks that a large-scale magnetic field could be built using some sort of machine or or experimental technology.
He's brilliant, isn't he? He's really brilliant.
Is he single too? What if it's them? To build a machine like this, you need resources.
You need scientists, you need funding, - tens of millions of dollars.
- Joyce.
It can't just be a coincidence, Hopper.
It has to be them.
Joyce, stop.
It has to be the lab.
It is impossible.
- Well, then, prove it to me.
- Prove it? - Yeah, take me back there.
- To the lab.
Yeah, I wanna go back.
Because some magnets fell off your fridge.
Yes.
Okay, makes sense.
Thank you.
It makes sense.
I'm sorry.
I'm a little busy right now, but maybe we can meet up there, like tonight, like seven o'clock? You know, of course, unless something comes up - which, you know, it will.
- You know, after everything that's happened, this is no joke.
No, I don't think it's a joke.
I think that when I asked you out, I think you got scared.
I think you got scared, and now, you're inventing things.
You're inventing things to get worked up about so that you can push me away.
Because God forbid any of us move on! Because that that would be I mean, that would be too much, right, Joyce? You know? That would be too much, wouldn't it, Joyce? Wouldn't it, Joyce? Joyce? Joyce! - What the hell are you doing? - I need to borrow these.
No, you're not going back there.
Joyce Joyce, you're not going back there Son of a bitch! It's gonna start pouring soon.
We should be at the mall or, like, watching a movie or something.
You don't believe me? I believe you saw some super weird stuff, totally, but you said Mike has sensed you in there before, right? So maybe it was just like that.
Maybe Billy just sensed you somehow.
- But the screams.
- Yeah, I know, but here's the thing.
When Billy is alone with a girl, they make, like, really crazy noises.
- They scream? - Yeah, but, like happy screams.
- Happy screams? What is happy screams? - It's like I'm just gonna lend you my mom's Cosmo.
His car's not here.
You really want to do this? Why do I get the feeling we're gonna find all kinds of wrong in here? Ugh! Gag me with a spoon.
Max? Ice.
It's just ice.
Probably for his muscles or something.
He works out like a maniac.
El, what is it? You sure about this? You really are your mother's son, you know that? What's that supposed to mean? It means you worry too much.
- Huh.
- I got this, okay? Okay.
So, what exactly are we looking at here? Is this the Driscoll lady's stuff? No.
No, see, that's the thing.
I mean, listen, I thought she was crazy too, but She told me Johnson killed Kennedy.
But, it turns out, she's not alone.
Blackburn's Supply, Hawkins Farming, the Crawleys, they've all had some supplies go missing, all in the past few days.
And it's not just fertilizer.
It's pesticides, cleaning supplies, diesel fuel.
And that's just from one day of calling around.
I mean there's gotta be more.
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Let me get this little story of yours straight.
So, little rodents have gone cuckoo in their furry little minds and they're running around the town of Hawkins, dining out on chemicals.
I know how it sounds, but But you've got proof! I mean, fellas, you gotta admit, it's a hell of a headline, right? "Hawkins Rodents Prefer Poison: Nutjob Tells All.
" Guys, that's enough.
I think this is big.
Bigger than one article.
In fact, I think this has got to be a book.
The Mysterious Case of the Missing Fertilizer, a Nancy Drew mystery.
Next time a call comes in, do what you were hired for, and let us know, yeah? Ah We'll decide what's a story and what's not.
Okay.
Bye-bye, Nancy Drew.
Hey, it's okay.
Nancy.
Nancy! Excuse me.
Ahoy! I'd like to try the peanut butter chocolate swirl, please.
No.
No more samples today.
Why not? Because you're abusing our company policy.
Where's the sailor man? Sorry, he can't help you.
He's busy.
Busy with what? Spycraft.
You see anything? Uh, I guess I don't totally know what I'm looking for.
Evil Russians.
Yeah, exactly.
I don't know what an evil Russian looks like.
- Tall, blond, not smiling.
- Mm-hmm? Also, look for earpieces, camo, duffel bags, that sort of thing.
Right, okay, duffel bags.
- Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
- What? Anna Jacobi's talking with that meathead Mark Lewinsky.
If you're not gonna focus, just gimme the binoculars.
Aw, Jesus Christ, whatever happened to standards? I mean, Lewinsky never even came off the bench.
Dude, you are the worst spy in history, you know that? - Stop, hey.
Stop.
- Give me those.
I don't get why you're looking at girls.
You have the perfect one in front of you.
- Seriously, if you say Robin again - Robin.
- No, don't.
No.
- Robin, Robin, Robin.
- Stop, no, no, no.
- Robin.
Robin.
- Robin.
- No.
- Robin.
- No! No, man, she's not my type.
She's not even in the ballpark of what my type is, all right? What's your type again? Not awesome? - Thank you.
- Hm.
For your information, she's still in school.
And she's weird.
She's a weirdo.
And she's hyper.
I don't like that she's hyper.
And she did drama.
That's a bad look.
And she's in band? - No.
- Now that you're out of high school, which means you're technically an adult, don't you think it's time you move on from primitive constructs such as popularity? Oh, primitive constructs? That some stupid shit you learned at Camp Know Nothing? Camp Know Where, actually.
- And no, it's shit I learned from life.
- Hm.
Instead of dating somebody you think's gonna make you cooler, why not date somebody you actually enjoy being around? Like me and Suzie.
Oh, Suzie.
Yeah, you mean, "hotter than Phoebe Cates.
" Yeah, that Suzie.
And, uh, let's think about how exactly did you score that beautiful girlfriend? Oh, yeah.
With my advice.
Because that's how this works, Henderson.
I give you the advice, you follow through.
Not the other way around, all right, pea-brain? Do you guys hear that? It sounds like thunder.
But, no, wait.
That's not thunder.
It's a horde of juju zombies! Sir Mike, your action.
What should I do? Attack? Okay, I attack with my flail.
Whoosh! You miss.
Your flail clanks the stone, the zombie horde lumbers towards you, and the juju bites your arm.
Flesh tears! Aah! Seven points of damage.
Oh, no, my arm.
Lucas, look, my arm.
Sir Lucas, the zombie horde roars! Do you fight back or do you run? No! It's a distraction! A trap.
Do not answer it.
What No! El? No.
Sorry, not interested.
Telemarketers.
Maybe we should just call them.
We can do that? - I think so.
- Yeah, but what would we say? We'll say nothing! The Khuisar tribe still needs your help.
All right, then.
I'll use my torch to set fire to the chambers, sacrificing ourselves, killing the jujus, and saving the Khuisar.
We all live on as heroes in the memories of the Kalamar.
Victory.
Okay.
Fine.
You guys win.
- Congratulations.
- Will, I was just messing around.
Hey, let's finish for real.
- How much longer is the campaign? - Just forget it, Mike.
No, you want to keep playing, right? Y-Yeah, totally.
We'll just call the girls afterwards.
I said forget it, Mike, okay? - I'm going home.
- But - Come on, Will.
- Move! Will, come on.
You can't leave.
It's raining.
Listen, I said I was sorry, all right? It's a cool campaign.
It's really cool.
We're just not in the mood right now.
Yeah, Mike.
That's the problem.
You guys are never in the mood anymore.
- You're ruining our party.
- That's not true.
Really? Where's Dustin right now? See? You don't know and you don't even care.
And obviously he doesn't either and I don't blame him.
You're destroying everything, and for what? So you can swap spit with some stupid girl? El's not stupid.
It's not my fault you don't like girls.
I'm not trying to be a jerk.
Okay? But we're not kids anymore.
I mean, what did you think, really? That we were never gonna get girlfriends? We were just gonna sit in my basement all day and play games for the rest of our lives? Yeah.
I guess I did.
I really did.
Will.
Will! Will, come on! Excuse me.
No one in the water until 30 minutes after the last strike.
And don't try and argue with me.
You wanna get electrocuted, go climb a tree.
Yeah, we don't care.
We're not here to swim.
Or get electrocuted.
We found this.
Does that belong to anybody? Oh, yeah.
That's Heather's.
I'll get it back to her.
We could give it back to her.
You could.
'Cept she's not here.
Bailed on me today.
What is this? You girls want a reward or somethin'? No.
We're just Good Samaritans.
Heather.
Do you think you can find her? No way! What do you see? A door.
A red door.
Help me.
Help me! No! What happened? El! Hello? Anybody home? We come in peace.
No! No! Let's go! Joyce.
You okay? I'm fine.
You want to wait in the car? I said I'm fine.
- Target acquired.
- Where? - Ten o'clock.
Sam Goody's.
- Give me that.
Shit.
Duffel bag.
Evil Russian.
Slow down.
We're losin' him.
- You're getting too close.
- Watch it, dickwad.
Hello.
Yes.
I am fine.
How are you? All right, everyone, listen up! I just have one question for you.
Who is ready to sweat? That's right! Okay! Let's start it nice and easy now.
Let's move our thighs.
Yeah! Yeah, ladies, warm it up.
Bring it down to your hips.
Start feeling that burn, everywhere, down in the loins, right? Come on, ladies, show me what you got.
Slow now.
Just isolate.
Ooh, tip that up.
That feels good! "The week is long.
" The silver cat feeds when blue meets yellow in the west.
"A trip to China sounds nice if you tread lightly.
" "Tread lightly"? - Delivery for you.
- Thank you.
- Have a nice day.
- Yeah, you too.
Silver cat.
Silver cat.
You're not gonna believe who Dustin thought was a Russian.
- You did too.
- No, I did not.
- Yes, you did.
- No, I did not.

Robin.
What are you doing? - I cracked it.
- Cracked what? I cracked the code.
Oh-ho-ho! Oh! There it is! Careful! It might have rabies! Better get that thing outta here.
You don't want it eatin' the tires off your car.
Come on! What - What's this? - Proof.
Proof? They said they wanted proof, right? So let's give it to 'em.
A rubber rat? No, the real rat.
Driscoll's rat.
You said yourself it looked sick.
We can take it to an animal control center, they can run some blood tests on it, - figure out what's wrong with it - Whoa, Nancy, slow down.
Tom didn't ask for proof.
He asked us to drop the story.
That's because he didn't believe us.
- Nancy.
- I'm right.
That's not the point.
Then what's the point? You should've thought about that before you talked to them.
All right? They're assholes, okay? I get it.
But it's just some stupid story.
Oh, it's stupid? It's stupid to get fired over.
No one's going to fire us.
Look, if you don't want to go, that's fine.
Just give me the keys.
You're relentless, you know that? Come on.
Nobody's home.
All the cavities have been filled.
I watched 'em do it, Joyce.
Will! It's over.
It's over.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
You're not losing your mind.
Not any more than I am.
You know, the other day, I almost shot Betsy Payne's dog because it came rushing at me from behind this fence, and I I swear to God, I thought it was one of those things.
You know that I'm keeping a close eye on things, right? - Yeah.
- Because it's important to me.
It is important to me that you feel safe.
That you and your family feel safe.
I want you to feel like this can still be your home.
What? You didn't think I'd find out about that? Gary called me.
He said he's fixing up your house to put on the market.
The kids know yet? After Sarah I had to get away.
I had to get the hell out of that place, you know? Outrun those, uh those memories, I guess.
I mean, why do you think I ended up back in this shithole? But you have something that I never had.
You have people that know what you've been through.
You have people that care about you.
Right here.
In Hawkins.
You mean You mean, people like Scott Clarke.
That was a joke.
Mm.
What's that? Wait here.
Will! Will, I'm sorry, man, all right? I was being a total asshole.
Please, can you just come outside and we'll talk? Will! Hey, Will! Come on, man! We're sorry! Will! Something is coming, something hungry for blood.
- What is it? - What if it's the Demogorgon? Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed if it's the Demogorgon.
It's not the Demogorgon.
- Will, your action! - Fireball! Fourteen! Direct hit! Will the Wise's fireball hits the thessalhydra! - Who you gonna call? - Ghostbusters! - Egon! - Venkman! Stupid.
So stupid.
So stupid.
Stupid.
Mrs.
Driscoll? Oh, she must not be home.
She's an 80-year-old woman and it's pouring.
Where else would she be? - Whoa, what are you doing? - Maybe she fell.
Or something.
Nancy Mrs.
Driscoll? - Seriously? - Mrs.
Driscoll? It's Nancy.
From The Hawkins Post.
Mrs.
Driscoll? Mrs.
Driscoll? Look for Imperial Panda and Kaufman Shoes.
They're with that whistling guy, ten o'clock.
- What do you think's in there? - Guns, bombs? Chemical weapons? Whatever it is, they're armed to the teeth.
Great.
That's great.
Hey, what's in there? It's just more boxes.
Let me check it out.
- No, I'm still looking.
- Lemme see it.
Hang on! Duck! Stay here.
Watch the door.
Well, I think we found your Russians.
This is Hawkins Chief of Police! Come out with your hands up! You hear me? Hands up! Hopper! Hopper! Hopper! Hopper! Hopper! Is this it? - This is her house.
- What? Heather's house.
Isn't that cute, huh? He's so funny.
Max.
We didn't mean to barge in.
We tried to knock, but maybe you didn't hear us over the storm.
I'm sorry, who is this dripping all over my living room right now? I'm sorry.
Janet, Tom, this is my sister, Maxine.
Oh! What on earth are you doing here? Is something wrong? We just wanted to make sure everything was okay.
Okay? - Why wouldn't it be okay? - Where is she? I'm sorry.
Where is who? Well, they're a little burnt, I'm sorry Heather! This is my sister, Maxine.
And, I'm sorry, I did not quite catch your name.
El.
El.
Now, what is it you were saying, El? You were looking for somebody? I I saw - I saw you - Your manager.
At the pool.
He said you guys didn't come in to work today, so we got worried.
Heather wasn't feeling so hot today, so we thought we'd take the day off to nurse her back to health.
But you're feeling just fine right now, aren't you, Heather? I'm feeling so much better.
Do you girls want a cookie? They're fresh out of the oven.
Will! Will! What happened? Are you okay? He's back.
He was singin' Bye bye Miss American Pie Is everything all right? Yes.
Everything's fine.
Your sister really didn't want to stay? No, she's just not you know, really a people person.
Well, I just don't like the idea of them out there in the storm like that.
Oh, they'll be fine.
Oh! I told you to slow down on that wine, Janet.
Yes, darling.
Are you okay, Mommy? Yes, I'm I'm just feeling a little lightheaded is all.
Hm.
It's all that wine.
I'm sorry.
Um, if you'll excuse me, I'm just gonna go upstairs and lie down for a bit.
Janet? half-time air was sweet perfume Janet? Janet? Janet! Janet! Call 911! Call 91 never got the chance I'm really sorry about this, Daddy, but it'll all be over soon, I promise.
we started singin' Bye bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good ol' boys were drinking whiskey and rye Singin' this'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die Oh, and there we were all in one place A generation lost in space With no time left to start again So come on Jack be nimble Jack be quick Jack Flash sat on a candlestick 'Cause fire is the Devil's only friend Oh, and as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in Hell Could break that Satan's spell And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial rite I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the music died He was singin' Bye bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good ol' boys were drinking whiskey and rye Singin' this'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die

1 [THUNDER RUMBLING] [BILLY] I'm sorry, I did not quite catch your name.
[DISTORTED SCREAMING] [MAX] What happened? Help me.
[SCREAMING] No! [THUNDERCLAP] Which one? I don't know.
Hey, there's nothing to worry about anymore, okay? It doesn't make sense.
What doesn't make sense? Heather.
The blood.
The ice.
Heather had a fever, so she took a cold bath, but she's better now.
That has to be it.
I don't know where that blood came from, but we saw her.
We both saw her.
She's totally fine.
What about Billy? What about him? He seemed wrong.
[CHUCKLES] Wrong is kind of like his default.
But it's nice to know he's not a murderer, because that would've totally sucked.
[CHUCKLES] Who is that? See, this is why you can't just hang out with Mike all the time.
This is Wonder Woman.
AKA Princess Diana.
She's from Paradise Island, which is, like, this hidden island where there are only women Amazon warriors.
[THUNDER RUMBLING] [MRS.

[HOPPER SIGHS] [RETCHING] Oh.
Here, here, here.
[COUGHING, VOMITING] It's okay.
[LOUD VOMITING] That's it.
Got it? [GROANS] - Here.
- How long have I been out? A while.
You've been drifting in and out.
Yeah, but how did I get here? Slowly.
- What's the last thing you remember? - Some thug attacked me.
- Hey, you need to rest.
- No, I'm fine.
- No, you're not fine, Hop - I'm fine.
I'm fine.
[EXCLAIMS] Um - Where are my clothes? - Uh Uh [SHARP EXHALE] They were soaked.
I mean, did you recognize him? - Who? - The thug.
[HOPPER] Well, I didn't get a good look.
Well, I mean, he's gotta be government, right? Yeah, but if he's government, what's he doing slinking around? W-Why is he running? You know, why didn't we find anything down there? Let's ask him.
What is that? His license plate.
- What are the dashes? - Well, they're blanks.
There was I think it was either an H or a P with the part rubbed off.
And there was definitely a Y.
For sure.
And that, I think, was a B, but it could've been an eight.
And that Wait I think you should stick to sales.
Can't you run a search or something? I just think you have to lower your expectations.
I mean, this is a state government agency.
Gonna take weeks before they find a match.
- Weeks? - If we're lucky.
And, I mean, what are the odds that this guy registers a car in his own name? It wasn't a car.
[CLEARS THROAT] Uh, what are you wearing? What do you mean it wasn't a car? [LUCAS OVER RADIO] Do you copy? This is a code red.
[RADIO STATIC POPS] I repeat, this is a code red.
Max.
Do you copy? - This is a code red.
- [MAX SCOFFS] Shut up.
She turned it off.
[PHONE RINGING] [SCOFFS] You've got to be kidding me.
I'm sleeping.
Go away.
[MIKE] This is Mike.
Do not hang up.
Something happened, something bad.
Our very lives can be at stake.
- What are you talking about? - Just come over to my house.
We'll explain everything.
- [MAX] What? - Hurry.
[CLICK, DIAL TONE DRONES] What did he say? Try Dustin again.
He's not answering.
So, try him again.
Dustin, do you copy? I repeat, this is a code red.
[DUSTIN] That keycard opens the door, but unfortunately, the Russian with this keycard also has a massive gun.
Whatever's in this room, whatever's in those boxes, they really don't want anybody finding it.
But there's gotta be a way in.
Well, you know I could just take him out.
- Take who out? - The Russian guard.
What? I sneak up behind him, I knock him out, and I take his keycard.
It's easy.
Did you not hear the part about the massive gun? Yes, Dustin, I did.
And that's why I would be sneaking.
Ah.
Well, please, tell me this, and be honest, have you ever actually won a fight? Okay, that was one time Twice.
Jonathan.
Year prior? Listen, that doesn't count.
Why wouldn't it? Because it looks like he beat the shit out of you.
- It was - You got a fat lip, crooked nose, - swollen eye, a lot of blood - things that all added up That just might work.
[STEVE] Robin.
Hey, Robin! Hey, what what are you doing? - I need cash.
- Well, half of that's mine.
- Where're you going? - To find a way into that room, a safe way.
And, in the meantime, sling ice cream, behave, and don't get beat up.
I'll be back in a jiff.
Oh, dude.
Come on, man, not my scooper.

[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Nancy.

[TOM] I've worked at this paper for twenty-five years.
Twenty-five years.
Now, we're a small-town paper, but we have something the big papers don't have: trust.
- The trust of our community.
- Tom, if you just Do you know how I built that trust? By placing my faith in something the two of you don't seem to value a whole lot: facts.
Facts.
So, while we're here, let's go over the facts.
Fact one: you disobeyed a direct order to stop pursuing this story.
Two: you falsely identified yourselves as reporters, repeatedly lying to an elderly woman.
Three: you broke into her home, committing trespass.
Four: she almost died en route to the hospital.
She would've died if we hadn't shown up! Whatever disease that rat had clearly passed to her Five! Mrs.
Driscoll is a paranoid schizophrenic.
You didn't know that, did you? Now disease-carrying rats? The second coming of the plague? Does this sound credible to you, or perhaps does this sound more like the delusions of a very sick old lady? - I didn't know that.
- Her family's furious.
So furious, in fact, they've threatened litigation.
- Litigation? - That's crazy.
For once, we agree.
This is crazy.
In fact, in my entire professional career, I've never dealt with anything quite like it.
But hopefully, hopefully, you've learned something valuable here.
You've learned how in the workplace, in the real world, there are consequences to your actions.
Which brings me to my sixth and final fact.
You're fired.
Both of you.
[WILL] I didn't think it was anything at first.
I mean, I think I just didn't want to believe it.
The first time I felt it was at Day of the Dead.
[FLUTTERING SOUND] - Power went out that night, too.
- And then I felt it again at the field near the Nelson farm the next day.
[GASPS] Then again yesterday outside Castle Byers.
[FLUTTERING SOUND] [LUCAS] Will! What does it feel like? It's almost like You know when you drop on a roller coaster? - Sure.
- Yeah.
- No.
- It's like everything inside your body is just sinking all at once, but this is worse.
Your body it goes cold and and you can't breathe.
I've felt it before, whenever he was close.
- [THUNDERCLAP] - [SNARLING] Whenever who was close? The Mind Flayer.
Go away! Go away! I closed the gate.
I know, but what if he never left? What if we locked him out here with us? This is him.
All of him.
But, that day on the field, a part of him attached itself to me.
[HYPERVENTILATING] My mom got it out of me Get the hell out of my son! and Eleven closed the gate.
[SCREAMING] But the part that was still in me, what if it's still in our world? In Hawkins.
I don't understand.
The Demodogs died when El closed the gate.
[MAX] If the brain dies, the body dies.
We can't take any chances.
We need to assume the worst.
The Mind Flayer's back.
[WILL] Yeah.
And if he is, he'd want to attach himself to someone again.
A new me.
A new host.
How can you tell if someone is a host? [HOPPER GRUMBLES] Hey, is he in? - Yes, he's busy at the moment, but - Great.
Excuse me.
You should sit down.
wouldn't listen Uh Tony, hold on.
Let me, uh I might have to Let me call you back.
Okay.
Thanks.
- Jim.
- I know, I know.
You're busy.
I'm gonna make this fast, I promise.
Is there some kind of problem? Yeah.
You might say that.
Um, I'm looking for the name of a guy.
The name of a guy.
Yeah, I think you might know this guy.
- Okay.
- He was here the other day.
Rides a motorcycle.
Big build, square jaw, dark hair.
He's probably military, maybe ex-military? Is this ringing any bells? Uh [CHUCKLES] I don't think so.
Really? 'Cause it was just two days ago.
This was right before I saw you.
Oh! - You know what? - What? Could be the maintenance guy.
- Maintenance.
- Yeah.
I can't remember his name.
Oh, God Uh Gary or John or something.
Candice will have his name on file.
We've had trouble with the plumbing.
Clogged toilets and sinks with minds of their own.
[CHUCKLES] You meeting with a lot of plumbers, Larry? Excuse me? This guy, when I saw him, he was coming out of your office.
Okay, well, I don't remember that.
I shake a lot of hands, you know? Do you remember when I caught you passed out in the hideaway with all that powder all over your nose? - You remember? - Jim, come on, now.
Do you remember when my boys found you and Candice going at it like a couple of bunnies in the back of your Cadillac? Do you remember that? Does your wife remember that? You, uh [CLEARS THROAT] You really wanna play this game? Huh? Not a game, Lar.
Okay.
Those pills you used to swallow like candy.
I can't recall, did you have a prescription for those? Or how about drinking on duty? [CHUCKLING] Yeah.
We have some real fun stories about that.
[CHUCKLES] One call to Tom at the Post and you're done, buddy.
You're gone.
Oh, and, please, don't give me that dead daughter sob story, 'cause I just don't care.
Now, if you don't mind, I really am rather busy.
Operating directors [LARRY GRUNTS] Damn it! [WAILING] My nose! You broke my goddamn nose! And your friend almost killed me last night, so I'd say we're still not even.
Larry? - [HOPPER] Let's cut the crap, Larry! - Larry! - Who is this guy? Government? Military? - You're making a big mistake.
Who is he? It's Arnold Schwarzenegger.
- [CANDICE] Larry! - [LARRY GROANS] Who you calling? The police? That is a nice ring you got there, Larry.
Are you insane? I don't know.
Let's find out.
[GRUNTS] Okay, okay, okay.
Be cool, be cool.
I don't know his name, I swear.
- [SIGHS] - [SCREAMS] Ah, ah, ah! But you know him.
He He gives me things sometimes.
What kind of things? Money.
Presents.
Aah! Gifts.
Who is this guy, Santa Claus? Starcourt.
Starcourt.
He works for Starcourt.
- The mall? - Yes, yes.
Yeah, right.
Aah! I swear! I swear! I swear! Starcourt.
They They own the mall.
They want to expand to East Hawkins.
They needed property, some land.
Some people didn't want to sell, so I leaned on them a little.
That's all.
I swear, that's all.
[SIGHS, GROANS] [GROANS] - Why do they want this land? - I don't know! You have records of these purchases, these, uh these land purchases? [BREATHING RAPIDLY] You don't want to mess with these people, Jim.
I think you should worry about yourself right now, Larry, not about me.
The records.
Where are they? - [LARRY GROANS] - Larry? [HOPPER] He just bumped his head.
- Just a little boo-boo, right, Lar? - [GRUNTS] Have a nice day.
Larry! [NANCY] It's bullshit.
So, according to Tom, Driscoll's just a schizophrenic? And that rat is just a rat? And it's all, what, some big coincidence? You know what I think? I think Tom was on drugs.
- What? - Did you see him? He was sweating like crazy.
And his palms were clammy.
- He looked awful.
- [CHUCKLES] - Oh, is this funny to you? - No.
No, it's just kind of incredible.
Incredible? Yeah, incredible how you just continue to convince yourself.
What's that supposed to mean? I told you over and over to drop this story.
- That it was a bad idea.
- [SCOFFS] But you refused, and now, I'm screwed.
It's a summer job.
Your life is hardly over.
I don't live in a two-story house on Maple Street.
My dad doesn't earn six figures.
Hell, he isn't even around.
God, here comes the Oliver Twist routine.
Mortgage, college tuition.
You know, they're real things, Nancy.
Things that you don't care about, only because you don't have to.
- I didn't realize I lived in a bubble! - Well, you do! You want everything handed to you on a silver platter.
I mean, we were interns, Nancy! Interns! What did you expect, that you would make star reporter in a month? Crack the big case? You sound just like them.
You realize that, right? Just like Bruce and those assholes Yeah, yeah, those assholes gave us jobs.
Is that what that was? That was humiliating.
Humiliating.
Yeah, the real world sucks.
Deal with it like the rest of us.
You don't know what it's like.
Neither do you.
[SCOFFS] Well, then, I guess we just don't understand each other anymore.
Yeah, I guess not.
Hey, you're home early.
Yeah.
Light day.
[NANCY SNIFFLES] [ROBIN] It is fascinating what 20 bucks will get you at the County Recorder's Office.
Starcourt Mall.
The complete blueprints.
Not bad.
So, this is us, Scoops, and this is where we want to get.
I mean, I don't really see a way in.
There's not, if you're talking exclusively about doors.
Air ducts.
Exactly.
Turns out, this secret room needs air just like any old room.
And these air ducts lead all the way here.
Flashlight.
Thank you.
Yeah, I don't know, man.
I don't know if you can fit in here.
It's, like super tight.
I'll fit.
Trust me.
No collar bones, remember? Uh, excuse me? Oh, he's, uh Yeah, he's got some disease.
Chry, uh It's chrydo, um Something.
Yeah, I dunno.
He's missing bones and stuff.
He can bend like Gumbo.
You mean Gumby.
I'm pretty sure it's Gumbo.
- Steve, just shut up and push me! - Okay.
I'll push ya.
- Not my feet, dumbass.
Push my ass.
- [STEVE] What? Touch my butt! I don't care! - Come on! Harder! Push harder! - I'm pushing! You're playing with my legs.
I'm not playing, I have terrible footing.
- Come on! - I'm gonna just shove you, ready? - [DUSTIN] Just shove me? - One, two - Shit.
- [STEVE] That work? - [DUSTIN] One more time.
- Ahoy, sailors! All hands on deck! Ahoy! - [BELL DINGING] - [ERICA] Come on.
Get over here and serve me some samples.
I don't know.
He looks pretty normal to me.
Normal? How many times have you seen him with a shirt on? I mean, it's a little weird.
More than a little.
He was in a tub with ice.
The Mind Flayer likes it cold.
- Plus everything else - But he's lounging at the pool, which is, like, the least Mind Flayer thing ever.
Not necessarily.
The Mind Flayer likes to hide.
He only used me when he needed me.
It's like like you're dormant.
And then, when he needs you, you're activated.
Okay, so we just wait until he gets activated.
No.
What if he hurts someone? Or kills someone.
We can't take that chance.
We need to find out if he's the host.
- Where are you going? - I have an idea.
Boys only.
- Seriously? - Just trust me on this one.
Okay, so we wait until the pool closes, until everyone leaves, and we somehow get him to come from here and get him into here.
- Hey, shut the door! - [MAN] Hey, come on, kid, shut it! I think I just threw up in my mouth.
And look, the controls are right here.
It's perfect.
- Will it get hot enough? - 220 degrees.
We just have to figure out how to get him in here.
- Then we lock him in - Heat him up No matter what happens, we'll know.
We'll know for sure.
Hmm - Yeah, I don't know.
- You don't know if you can fit? Oh, I can fit.
I just don't know if I want to.
Are you claustrophobic? [SNICKERS] I don't have phobias.
- Okay, well, what's the problem? - The problem is, I still haven't heard what's in this for Erica.
[NAUTICAL TUNE PLAYING] More fudge, please.
Go on.
[ROBIN] All right.
You see this? This is the route you're gonna take.
Then we just wait till the last delivery goes out tonight.
Then you knock out the grate, jump down, open the door.
- Then you find out what's in those boxes? - Exactly.
[ERICA] Mm-hmm.
And you say this guard is armed.
Yes, but he won't be there.
- And booby traps? - Booby traps? - Lasers, spikes in the wall? - What? You know what this half-baked plan of yours sounds like to me? Child endangerment.
We'll be in radio contact with you the whole time Ah, ah, ah! Child endangerment.
Erica? Hi.
Uh We think these Russians want to do harm to our country.
Great harm.
Don't you love your country? You can't spell "America" without "Erica".
[SLURPING LOUDLY] Uh, yeah, yeah.
Oddly, that's, uh, totally true.
So, so, don't do this for us.
Do it for your country.
Do it for your fellow man.
- [SLURPING CONTINUES] - Do this for America Erica.
Ooh! I just got the chills.
Oh, yeah, from this float, not your speech.
Know what I love most about this country? Capitalism.
- Do you know what capitalism is? - Yeah.
- Yeah.
- It means this is a free market system.
Which means people get paid for their services, depending on how valuable their contributions are.
And it seems to me, my ability to fit into that little vent is very, very valuable to you all.
So, you want my help? This USS Butterscotch better be the first of many.
And I'm talking free ice cream for life.
[HOPPER WHISTLES] Wow, I love the place, Lar.
Hey, you shoot that fella yourself? [LARRY WINCES] That's That's not real.
No shit! All right, so what exactly are we looking at? Land deeds, transfers of property.
So your buddies at Starcourt, they suddenly start buying up all this property.
- They tell you why? - I already told you, they don't tell me anything.
They're just using you, I get it.
What I don't get is why you have a bunch of land deeds in a safe in your bedroom.
These people, Jim, they're bad news.
So, what, this is blackmail? - Protection.
- Protection.
Hold on a second.
Hey, what is it? Hess Farm, Henry's place, Bullocks Look, they're all here.
They're all in Southeast Hawkins, right near Jordan Lake.
And what else is near Jordan Lake? The power plant.
Four nights ago, there was a huge power outage, - and the next day - Your magnets fell.
Yeah, I mean, Scott says that this machine would take a massive amount of power to run.
- Yeah.
- So, what if this machine that we've been talking about really does exist, and the reason that we didn't find it at the lab is because it isn't at the lab, it's at one of these properties.
Um I want you to forget about sales.
I want you to come work for me at the Hawkins PD.
And have to look at your face every day? I don't think so.
[CLATTERING] Larry! Hey! Hey, where do you think you're going, pal? [LARRY SCREAMS] - [KNOCKING] - [KAREN] Nancy? Nance? [SNIFFLES] [NANCY] Maybe Jonathan's right.
To be honest, I wasn't thinking about him.
I wasn't thinking about anyone, really.
I just I wanted to be right.
- I wanted to be right so badly.
- And were you? I thought so.
But maybe I just don't want to admit that I'm wrong, because if I'm wrong, then You're what everyone thinks you are.
Just a kid who has no idea what she's doing.
[SIGHS] It's not easy out there, Nance.
I know.
People are always saying you can't.
That you shouldn't.
That you're not smart enough, not good enough.
[SIGHS] This world, it it beats you up again and again until eventually, I Most people, they just they just stop trying.
But you're not like that.
You're a fighter.
You always have been.
I honestly don't know where you get it from.
[CHUCKLES] Dad.
[BOTH LAUGH] I think you were swapped in the hospital, to tell you the truth.
No.
I get it from you, Mom.
I get it from you.
Well, wherever you get it from, I'm proud of you.
Proud of me for getting fired? That you stood up for yourself.
That you stood up to those shitheads.
Mom! Yes, those shitheads.
[CHUCKLES, SNIFFLES] And if you believe in this story Look at me, Nancy.
finish it.
Then go sell it to The Indianapolis Star or whatever and I mean, can you imagine their faces when they read a story about their own town in a big paper like that? That would be pretty amazing.
So, why not? Why not? Finish it.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [LIGHTER CLICKS] Uh, Will? Um, you know, about yesterday It's fine, Lucas.
You don't have to say anything.
I know, but it's just It was a really cool campaign.

What if he's right? - What? - Hop.

He's just some angry old man who hates joy.
But if I only see you, and I'm a different species than you, then I should be with my species more.

They have to do something.
Yeah, if we had a keycard.

Same as the loading dock door.
If we don't have a keycard, - it won't operate, meaning - We're stuck in here.
Yeah.

Why's that? Because you are policeman.
Policemen have rules.
Oh, yeah? [GUN CLICKS] Wanna test that theory? I'm gonna count to three.
One, two, three! [HOPPER GRUNTS] [YELLING] [FIGHTING GRUNTS] [BULLETS RICOCHETING] [JOYCE SCREAMS, GRUNTS] [HOPPER YELLS] [FIGHTING GRUNTS] [GROANS, COUGHS] [GRIGORI WAILS IN PAIN] [BOTH PANTING] [JOYCE] Hopper! - Oh, shit.

[RINGING CONTINUES] [GROANS] - Hello? - Jonathan.
Do you realize what time it is? Listen to me, okay? It's 6:00 a.
m.
and, uh, I had a late night with Fagin and the gang, so - I'm at the hospital with Driscoll.
- What? She's been sedated for a few hours and the doctors are still running tests.
Nancy, please tell me you're joking.
It's not a joke.
And, yes, I know I'm insane and irrational and out of touch, but can you save your lecture, because I really don't give a shit right now.
I just I need you to put me on the phone with your brother.
- What? - Jonathan Please.
Uh He's not even here.
Where is he? Is he safe? Why wouldn't he be safe? Nancy? Why wouldn't he be safe? [STEAM HISSING] [HOPPER] Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch! [HOPPER COUGHS] Okay, a magnet? Magnets? - Do you know "magnet"? Magnet? - [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Magnit.
Yes, magnit.
Okay, so, uh, magnit on my my fridge, my icebox, and then they they fell.
They demagnetized, stopped working.
Uh, do you understand? Da.
Okay, so is that because of the machines that you're working on? - Machina.
- Machina, machina, yes.
[IMITATES REVVING ENGINE] Da, da, machina.
- Machina, machina! - Yes, machina Vroom, vroom.
Oh, not not the car.
The machines at Hess Farm where - where we kidnapped you - Joyce, please! You're givin' me a headache, both of you! Hold on, please.
One minute.
[JOYCE] Hey.
I am making progress.
- Progress.
- Yeah.
What have you learned, huh? You learned that Smirnoff over there - [JOYCE] Alexei.
- Smirnoff is Russian and works for Starcourt, two things we already knew.
Thought we knew.
But now we know-know, because I've confirmed them.
You're welcome.
Yeah? Why don't you confirm whether this baby'll start, huh? - [HOPPER] Keep it in park, please.
- Yeah, duh! You do do something useful.
- You do something useful.
- [SIGHS] - [JOYCE SCOFFS] - [GROANS] [ENGINE TURNS OVER] [ELECTRIC CRACKLING] [SIGHS] It's not working.
Try it again.
[ENGINE TURNS OVER] Shit.
[ENGINE SPUTTERS] - [ELECTRIC CRACKLING] - Hey.
Hey.
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Stop, stop! Shut up, Smirnoff! [SPEAKING RUSSIAN RAPIDLY] Aw, come on! D'you hear me? I said shut your damn [HIGH-PITCHED SQUEALING] Shit! Oh, Jesus.
[JOYCE GASPS] [HOPPER] Whoa! [GASPS] Stop.
[JOYCE] I thought this friend of yours lived in Illinois.
He's not really a friend.
He's more like an acquaintance.
Oh? Okay, well Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Keep up, keep up, keep up.
- Easy.
- [INSECTS BUZZING] Okay, so this acquaintance - lives in Illinois? Correct? - [HOPPER] Yeah, yeah.
[JOYCE] So we're walking to Illinois? Yeah, yeah, we're gonna walk to Illinois.
You know, I figure we'll get there by, like, Friday evening.
I hope that works for your schedule.
Jesus Christ, Joyce.
- We're not walking to Illinois, okay? - Well, then what are we doing? I don't know, okay? I will I will figure something out.
Isn't there someone in Indiana who speaks Russian that You know what? I'm all ears, Joyce.
I'm all ears.
I'm all ears! [JOYCE] I mean, fine.
Just saying.
Gah! Ugh! Gah! [SIGHS] [HOPPER] Damn it.
I found him.
[MAX] Where is he? Woods.
- [TV STATIC HISSING] - Woods? He's with Will's mom.
My My mom? What are they doing? Ill annoy.
They're going to Ill-annoy.
- [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - [KAREN] Mike! Breakfast! Not now, Mom! Illinois? Illinois, like the state? The state of Illinois? [STAMMERS] Ill-annoy.
[TAP STOPS] [MAX] Does it still hurt? Only when I talk.
Well, it's a good thing you're not Mike, then.
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
" And you'd be in constant pain.
[BOTH CHUCKLE] [MIKE] Something's not right.
I can't get Hopper off my back all summer, now all of a sudden, he's hiking with Will's mom to Illinois? And Dustin's MIA, too? I mean, this can't be a coincidence.
What does it matter? The bottom line is, they're not here.
- It's up to us.
- Up to us to do what exactly? Find Billy and stop him.
Okay, yeah, that's a really nice sentiment, but even if El could find him again, and that's a pretty big if, then what? We burn the shit out of him and make sure he doesn't escape this time.
- Okay, then what? - Then we win.
No, see, that's the problem.
We don't.
We don't win.
We got the Mind Flayer out of Will before and he just came right back.
We don't just have to stop Billy, we have to stop the Mind Flayer.
- How in the hell do we do that? - I don't know.
Maybe El does.
What are they still doing in there? I don't know.
Girls just like hanging out in bathrooms.
Why? - I mean, I don't know.
- They're conspiring against me.
That's what you're concerned about now? It's not my main concern.
- It's just a sub-concern.
- I thought it was already over.
It's not over, okay? We're just taking a break.
She said she dumped your ass.
- That doesn't sound like a break.
- [MAX] It wasn't! You guys do realize we can still hear everything you're saying, right? [LAUGHS] [WHISPERS] Conspiring.
- I told you, they're conspiring.
- [KNOCK AT DOOR] Not now, Mom! [NANCY] Mike, open the door.
[DUSTIN] Code red, I repeat, code red.
Does anyone copy? This is a code red, I repeat, a code red.
This is a code red, I repeat, a code red.
Does anyone copy? We are innocent children and we are trapped under Starcourt Mall.
The Red Army has infiltrated Hawkins, and if we are found, they will torture and kill us.
[STEVE] Hey.
[GRUNTS] Gotta take it easy on that thing.
Gonna drain the battery.
- The mall just opened.
- So? So someone could be in range.
What do you think, Petey the Mall Cop is gonna rappel down here and save the day? All right, why are you such a cranky pants after getting to spend the night with Robin? Shh! Jesus Christ.
Will you just give up on your creepy dream already? I heard you guys talking all night.
We were trying to figure out a way to open up the door while you children were sleeping.
After eight hours, we're still exactly nowhere, which is, you know, probably just a little bit of the reason why I'm feeling just - a tad cranky.
- [UNZIPPING SOUND] What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? I'm taking a leak.
Look away.
Look away! [STEVE'S VOICE ECHOES] [SCOFFS] Can you redirect your stream, please? [ROBIN'S VOICE ECHOES] Ugh.
Hey, hey! Be careful, careful, careful! We don't even know what that is.
Exactly.
It could be useful.
Useful how? We can survive down here a long time without food, but if the human body doesn't get water, it will die.
I hate to break it to you, but this is not water.
No, but it's a liquid, and if it comes down to me drinking that shit or dying of thirst, I drink.
[SCOFFS] [DISTANT ELECTRONIC WHIRRING] We've got company.
[SUSPENSEFUL SYNTH MUSIC PLAYING] [BEEPING] [ELEVATOR DOOR THUDS] [INDISTINCT FEMALE VOICE ON PA] [SNIFFING] [IN RUSSIAN] You smell that? [IN RUSSIAN] What? Piss.
[SNIFFING] [ELEVATOR DOOR WHIRRING] [STEVE GRUNTS] Let's go.
- Go.
Go, go, go, go, go.
- [ERICA] I'm going! - Henderson.
Go, go.
- [VIAL BUCKLES] [ROBIN] Come on, Steve, let's go! [SIZZLING] - Jesus Christ.
- [ERICA] Ooh! You still wanna drink that? Holy mother of God.
Well hope you guys are in good shape.
Looking at you, roast beef.
Let's go, come on.
Why me? It was the same thing, the exact same thing that happened to Will last year.
And look at this.
Look at the body temperatures.
He likes it cold.
Okay, so this crazy old woman who was eating fertilizer - Mrs.
Driscoll.
- Right, yeah, Mrs.
Driscoll.
- What time was this attack? - Last night.
Right, but what time last night? - Around 9:00.
- You waited all night to call? I was waiting for the doctors to run some tests.
You weren't there? Well, I'm here now, aren't I? Hallelujah! Ooh.
Um, so, wha what time was your sauna test? [IN UNISON] Around 9:00.
Well, that proves it.
That proves my theory.
She's flayed, just like Billy.
- Flayed? - The Mind Flayer.
He flays people.
Takes over their mind.
Once they do that, they basically become him.
- If there are two flayed - We have to assume there are more.
Heather.
Billy was doing something to her.
[HEATHER WHIMPERS ECHO] She was scared.
She was screaming.
- [SCREAMS] - Bad screams.
- What's a good scream? - Max said - Doesn't matter.
- I'm sorry, I'm lost.
Who is Heather? - She's a lifeguard at the pool.
- Heather Holloway? [BOTH] Tom.
[CAR DOORS SHUT] Seriously? Welcome to my world.
[MIKE SCOFFS] Seat belts.
[INTENSE SYNTH MUSIC PLAYING] [INSECTS BUZZING] - Oh, my God.
Can you not walk so close? - What? Can you not walk so close to me? You stink.
[HOPPER LAUGHS] I get it, I get it.
You're upset, right? 'Cause I, uh I blew up the car? Yeah, with me in it.
Well, I just want to remind you of something, Joyce.
- I am not a mechanic.
- Yeah, clearly.
That's why you should've listened to Alexei.
Oh, right, yeah.
Your new boyfriend, right? Yes.
Every man I talk to from now on has to be my boyfriend.
Yeah, he reminds me a bit of a Russian Scott Clarke.
Oh, here we go.
Maybe you should go on a date.
I don't know, I'm thinking, like, Enzo's? - Whoa.
- What? He's running.
[ALEXEI WHIMPERS, GRUNTS] You son of a bitch! - [ALEXEI MUTTERS IN RUSSIAN] - [HOPPER] Hey! Smirnoff! Get back here! - [ALEXEI CHUCKLES] - Hey! C'mere! [GRUNTING] [HOPPER] Hey, c'mere! [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [ALL PANTING] - [BELL CHIMES] - [LIGHT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR BELL JINGLES] [GRUNTS] [MAN] You all gonna pay for those? [BURPS] [REGISTER BEEPING] So, what are you, some kinda bounty hunter? I'm a cop.
I'm undercover.
[HEAVY METAL PLAYING ON CAR STEREO] [MUSIC STOPS] Oh, hey, Karen, it's Joyce.
Yeah, I I'm just checking on Will.
At the movies? Just keep your mouth shut, all right? [SLURPING LOUDLY] All right, all right, hop in.
Come on, get in.
- Hey! - Hey! You "hey"! You "hey"! This is a police emergency, all right? I need to commandeer your vehicle.
What? As long as there's a a [HOPPER] What is your name, sir? - Todd.
- Todd? - Yeah.
- Todd.
- Todd.
- Todd listen to me.
That man in there, I know he doesn't look it, but he is one of the most dangerous men in the world.
He's, uh - murdered many children.
- What? Yeah, he's a true psychopath.
I tracked him over two state lines.
[JOYCE] Hey, what's going on? Ah, Detective Byers.
Uh this is Todd.
He's agreed to lend us his vehicle to transport our dangerous criminal.
Oh, yes, he very dangerous, uh, forger er.
Yeah.
Uh, child murderer.
- Child murderer? - We should really get going.
Hey, how do I get my car back? - You just call the station.
- What station? - [HEAVY METAL RESUMES] - Ooh, I like the sound of that, Todd! Hey, what station? You're doing the right thing! [TIRES SQUEALING] Hey, what the Hey! Dude! [DUSTIN] I mean, you have to admit, as a feat of engineering alone, this is impressive.
What are you talking about? It's a total fire hazard.
There's no stairs, there's no exit, there's just an elevator that drops you halfway to hell.
They're Commies.
You don't pay people, they cut corners.
To be fair to our Russian comrades, I don't think this tunnel was designed for walking.
Think about it, they developed the perfect system for transporting that cargo.
It all comes into the mall like any old delivery.
And then they load it up onto those trucks and nobody's the wiser.
[STEVE] You think they built this whole mall so they could transport that green poison? I very seriously doubt it's something as boring as poison.
It's gotta be much more valuable, like promethium or something.
What the hell is promethium? It's what Victor Stone's dad used to make Cyborg's bionic and cybernetic components.
You're all so nerdy, it makes me physically ill.
No, no, no.
No, don't lump me in with them.
I'm not a nerd, all right? [ROBIN] Why so sensitive, Harrington? Afraid of losing cool points to a ten-year-old child? No, I'm just saying I don't know jack shit about Prometheus.
[DUSTIN] Promethium.
Prometheus is a Greek mythological figure, but whatever.
All I'm saying is, it's probably being used to make something.
Or power something.
- Like a nuclear weapon? - Totally.
Walking towards a nuclear weapon.
That's great.
- That'd be great.
- But if they're building something, why here? I mean, Hawkins.
Seriously.
Of all places.
At the very best, we're a toilet stop on your way to Disneyland, but maybe that's it.
Maybe it's our very - You think the Russians know? - About - They could.
- So it's connected? - Maybe.
- How? I don't know, but it's [BOTH] Possible.
I'm sorry, is there something you'd like to share with the class? - [STATIC HISSING] - [MAN SPEAKS RUSSIAN ON RADIO] [BOTH] Walkie.
[MAN CONTINUES IN RUSSIAN] [MAN CONTINUES IN RUSSIAN] [IN RUSSIAN] "A trip to China sounds nice.
" If you tread lightly.
" It's the code.
- Wherever that broadcast is coming from - It's close.
And if there's one thing we know about that signal It can reach the surface.
Let's go.
[DOORBELL CHIMES] [DOORBELL CHIMES] [LOW FREQUENCY VIBRATION] Tom? Heather? Jesus, it's freezing.
[SNIFFS] Do you guys smell that? [ALL SNIFFING] Oh.
Oh, God.
More chemicals.
You think they're guzzling this shit? Yeah, either that or they just went on a hell of a cleaning spree.
But last year, Will didn't eat chemicals.
- Did you? - No.
This is something new.
Mr.
Clarke, fifth grade.
Posit.
What happens when you mix chemicals together? [LUCAS AND WILL] You create a new substance.
- What if they're making something? - [MAX] In themselves? I mean, come on, if you drink this crap, it'll kill you.
Yeah, if you're human.
[DISTANT, FAINT PULSING] [NANCY] Blood.
Yesterday, Tom had a bandage on his forehead.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] He was attacked.
Call 91 [GRUNTS] [THUNDERCLAP] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC INTENSIFIES] [DOOR HINGE CREAKS] They must have tied them.
They must have taken them somewhere.
[THUNDERCLAP] Mrs.
Driscoll.
She kept saying "I have to go back.
" [SHRIEKS] What if the flaying, it's taking place somewhere else? There must be a place where all this started, right? A source.
Somewhere he didn't want me to see.
[FAINT SHRIEKING NOISE] If we can find the source, then maybe we can stop him.
Or at least stop it from spreading or doing whatever the hell he's doing with those chemicals.
How do we find it? Mrs.
Driscoll.
If she wants to go back so badly, why don't we let her? [TODD] this guy comes up to me, I'm just pumping gas over here, and he Hey, whoa! Don't cross me right now! - [BELL JINGLES] - [LIGHT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [CASH REGISTER BEEPING] Busy day? You could say that.
Some psycho stole that dude's car.
What else? - What? - What else did he say? This psycho? No offense, but I already went over all this with the cops.
I'm not a cop.
Yeah, no shit, Khrushchev.
[GRUNTS] Oh, shit! [WHIMPERS] [GRIGORI] Don't look at them.
At me.
Tell me about this psycho.
[PANTING] Come on, let's go.
Move it.
[DOORS SLAM] I thought you said this guy was a journalist.
Yeah, he, uh he was.
Was? [BUZZER SOUNDS] [MURRAY] Look at the camera.
The camera, above you to the right.
Identify yourselves.
Jim Hopper, Joyce Byers, Smirnoff.
- Alexei.
- Alexei.
[MURRAY] Surname.
I don't know.
Family name! Yeah, I know.
I told I don't know, okay? Open the damn door! [JOYCE] Hopper.
It's all right.
Don't worry.
He's a little bit eccentric, but he's completely harmless.
- [SHOTGUN COCKS] - [JOYCE GASPS] Name.
[IN RUSSIAN] Get that out of my face, you bald American pig.
[IN RUSSIAN] I may be bald, but you're the one in handcuffs, Soviet scum.
[BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYING] Wait.
[DEVICE BEEPS AND WHINES] [ELECTRIC CRACKLING] [DEVICE WHIRS] [DEVICE BEEPS] [LOUD BEEPING] [IN RUSSIAN] Watch it.
[IN RUSSIAN] Silence, scum.
- How long is this gonna take, because I - No.
- No.
- No.
- No, you do not get to question me.
- [DEVICE BEEPS] You have dragged an enemy of the state into my home as carelessly as a child drags in shit on his shoe.
I will search him until I am satisfied.
[CLEARS THROAT] Jim.
C'mere.
[JOYCE] Just c'mere.
I need to talk to you.
[HOPPER] Yeah, what? - What? - This is not gonna work.
- What do you mean? - He's not eccentric, he's certifiable.
[LOUD BEEPING] - Glass houses, Joyce.
- What? - You know, pot calling the kettle black.
- Oh, come on.
- Excuse me! - What? Do me a favor and move your lovers' quarrel elsewhere.
- Oh, oh, this? - No, no, no.
Not a lovers' quarrel, pal.
Spare me! What is your problem? Please, stop talking! No! We have had a very long day.
We have been shot at, nearly blown up, walked God knows how many miles in a hundred degree heat, stole a car, all while being chased by this gigantic psychopath, all so we could bring him to you.
Because somehow, you're the closest person who speaks Russian, which I can't believe.
But that doesn't matter because, unfortunately, we're here.
So, if you don't mind, put that thing away, stop behaving like a jackass, and ask him what he's doing that's making my magnets fall off my damn fridge! Please.
[DEVICE WHINES] [BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYS LOUDLY] [INDISTINCT MALE VOICE ON PA] Okay, clear.
Clear, come on, let's go.
[ROBIN] Okay, that was close.
- [DUSTIN] Too close.
- Relax.
All right? Relax.
Nobody saw [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [FEMALE VOICE SPEAKING RUSSIAN ON PA] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [STEVE] Shit.
Jesus! - Red Dawn.
- I saw it.
- First floor, northwest.
- Saw what? The comms room.
You saw the comms room? Correct.
- Are you sure? - Positive.
The door was open for a second, and I saw a bunch of lights and machines and shit in there.
That could be a hundred different things.
I'll take those odds.
[SIGHS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [STEVE WHISPERS] All right.
We're gonna move fast, we're gonna stay low.
- Okay? - Okay.
[WOMAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [MAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Shh! Move it.
[DOOR PANEL BEEPS] Let's go.
Sh, sh.
Come on.

You want to walk all the way back? Well, we can hang out for a little bit, relax, have a picnic maybe.
Have a picnic? We came here for the radio.
[DUSTIN] This plan is way better.
If I knew Steve could knock out a Russian, that would've been our plan in the first place.
[LOW FREQUENCY PULSING] [MEN SPEAKING RUSSIAN] - but I guess you're - Guys.
There's something up there.

At all.
I never have.
I - I was just - Angry? Which I still don't get.
I mean, I was just completely, utterly, mortifyingly wrong.
Don't let that go to your head.
I won't.
I just look forward to you never doubting me again.
[ELEVATOR DINGS] [VENDING MACHINE WHIRRING] Oh, come on, you piece of shit! [LOW FREQUENCY VIBRATION] Thanks.

[ELECTRICITY CRACKLES] [TOM] She's gone home.
We were hoping you might come back.

Excuse me.
Excuse me.
What what are you doing? What's what's this doing here? - What? - Your stand.
It's right in the main thoroughfare.
Where do you want it, sir? [SCOFFS] Over there with the rest of the goddamn food stalls.
It isn't rocket science.
Sheesh, do I have to do everything myself? [OMINOUS SYNTH MUSIC PLAYING] [CLEARS THROAT] [LARRY] My friends in state PD, highway patrol, they're all on the lookout.
I got eyes everywhere.
The second he pops up I get a call.
A call? Yes.
A call.
[CHUCKLES] I mean, what more do you people want me to do? We want you to find him.
[SUCKS LIPS] Let me explain something to you.
This man is a moron, okay? He's driving around in a yellow convertible, for Christ's sakes.
He sticks out like a sore thumb.
I will find him.
And, when I do, may I suggest you bring some backup with you this time? - Backup.
- Some comrades.
Since last time, he got the better of you.
[LARRY GRUNTS] - [DOOR WHINES SHUT] - [CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYING] - [LARRY GROANS] - [HISSING NOISE] [RIDE POWERS UP] Please I I didn't mean that.
You You don't need backup.
This man is your fault, your problem.
You're lucky you still breathe.
[CHOKING] Very lucky.
Please.
I'm sorry.
I I have a bad temper.
I'm going to therapy.
You have one day to find this man for me.
Nod if you understand.
[CHOKING] [PLAYFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [HOPPER] Two Whoppers, extra ketchup, large fry, pack of Marlboro Reds, and one extra-large Slurpee.
Burger King is nowhere near the 7-Eleven, by the way.
Never said it was.
Let's try this again.
Joyce.
Alexei, the generators, what are they powering? And tell him that we know it is not the Starcourt Mall, so he can stop selling us that crap.
[IN RUSSIAN] Those generators you were working on, what are you powering? We know it's not the mall.
[IN RUSSIAN] This tastes like shit strawberry.
- What'd he say? - He says, "It's strawberry.
" I'm sorry? His Slurpee.
[MURRAY] He says it's strawberry.
So what? Hop, he did ask for cherry.
I mean Well, they didn't have cherry.
They didn't have it.
And it doesn't matter, because it all tastes the same, okay? It is sugar on ice.
You tell him that.
Tell him what? You tell him that it all tastes the goddamn same! [MURRAY, IN RUSSIAN] It's all the same.
Sugar on ice.
No difference.
[IN RUSSIAN] Tell that stupid man it is not the same in the slightest, and I would like the cherry I requested.
[MURRAY] It's not the same at all, and he would like - cherry.
- [CHUCKLES] Oh, yeah? You tell him he can forget it.
[IN RUSSIAN] He says forget it.
No cherry.
[IN RUSSIAN] No cherry, no deal.
[LAUGHS] "No cherry no deal.
" [SMACKS LIPS] [MURRAY] Yeah.
Hm.
[INHALES SHARPLY] Mm.
- [HOPPER YELLS] - [MURRAY] Oh, shit! - [YELLING] - [JOYCE] No, Hop - [GRUNTING] - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! - I'm not gonna hurt him! - [JOYCE] What are you doing? - [HOPPER GROWLS] - Come on! Come on! I'm just giving him an opportunity to get his own damn cherry Slurpee! - [HOPPER GRUNTS] - [ALEXEI WHIMPERS] [WHIMPERS] Jim, that man is an enemy of the state.
Yeah, who's been jerking us around for a full day! I get him his cherry Slurpee, then what? He wants a helicopter to charter him to his own private island.
I have dealt with assholes like this my entire life.
[HOPPER] Yesterday in the woods, he could've escaped, - but he didn't.
- [CHUCKLES] He stuck with us.
Why do you think that is? It's because he's scared.
[HOPPER] He's scared.
Not of us, of them.
He's scared of that seven-foot-tall Russian freak who could've killed him just as easily as us.
Smirnoff knows that if he runs back to his comrades without a scratch on him, they're gonna think that he spilled his guts.
So, whether he likes it or not, we are the best chance he's got.
Ooh! [GRUNTS IN PAIN] I give him 30 seconds before he comes knocking on that door, right back into our arms, with a new sense of humility.
- ["NEUTRON DANCE" PLAYS] - I don't wanna take it anymore [LAUGHS GIDDILY] - Jim - Uh I, uh, believe he has started the car.
Hopper.
You know, testing us.
He's just calling my bluff.
'Cause I work so hard to make it every day Woo-ooh I believe he is now driving away.
[GRUMBLES] [SCOFFS] [JOYCE GRUMBLES] Jim.
Jim, move.
- Joyce, Joyce - Move, move, move! Yeah Ooh-ooh, huh Yeah And it's hard to say Just how some things never change And it's hard to find Any strength to draw the line Ooh, I'm just burning doin' the neutron dance I'm just burning doin' the neutron dance [ENGINE SWITCHES OFF] I know there's a pot of gold for me All I've got to do is just believe [MUTTERING IN RUSSIAN] Doin' the neutron dance And I'm just burning I'm sorry, what did he say? He says he likes strawberry, too.
- I'm just burning - In my feet Doin' the neutron dance, woo-hoo [DUSTIN] So, when we set fire to the hub, we drew the Demodogs away so El could close the gate.
But now, for some insane reason, the Russians appear to be trying to reopen it, which just destroys everything we risked our lives for.
By "we", you're including Lucas? Yes, of course.
So, all that shit you told me, Lucas was there? - Yeah.
- My brother, Lucas Charles Sinclair? Yes! I don't believe you.
Wait, so you believe everything about El and the gate and the Demodogs and the Mind Flayer, but you question your brother's involvement? That's correct.
Makes total sense.
- Um, you need help with that? - No.
- Well, I mean, it's taking a while, so - Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.
All right, so if we don't find a more efficient method to stop these fans, we're never gonna find help, and your ice cream buddies are screwed.
Yeah, with that attitude, they are.
Jee-zus! I'm just being realistic.
I mean, we've made it about point-three miles in nine hours.
Then we had to walk three hours down that tunnel, so I'd estimate ten miles back to the elevator, which should take us approximately twelve-and-a-half days.
Did you just do all of that in your head? I'm good with numbers.
Holy shit.
You're a nerd.
Come again? You are a nerd.
Okay, you better take that back, nerd.
Can't put the truth back in the box.
- But it's not the truth.
- Let's examine the facts, shall we? Fact one: you're a math whiz, apparently.
That was a pretty straightforward equation.
Fact number two: you're a political junkie.
Just because I don't agree with Communism as an ideology Fact number three: you love My Little Pony.
And what does My Little Pony have to do with this? Ah, let's recall the ponies' latest adventure, shall we? The evil centaur team and Tirek turns Applejack into a dragon at Midnight Castle, and then Megan and the other ponies have to use Moochick's magic to defeat his rainbow of darkness, saving them from a lifetime of enslavement.
All the pink in the world can't disguise the irrefutable fact that centaurs and castles and dragons and magic are all standard nerd tropes.
Ergo, My Little Pony is nerdy.
Ergo, you, Erica, are a nerd.
And how do you know so much about My Little Pony? Because I'm a nerd.
[ELECTRICITY CRACKLES] [POWERING DOWN NOISE] Let's go nerd.
You [STEVE GROANS] That one stung.
[GASPS FOR AIR] Who do you work for? For the millionth time, I work at Scoops Ahoy! Scoops Ahoy.
[GROANS] [STEVE] What the hell?! Look at my outfit! Look at my outfit! You think I just wear this?! Think I'm a spy in a sailor's uniform? [GROANS] [GRUNTS] How did you get in? [GASPS] I already told you.
I told you before.
[GASPS FOR AIR] My delivery didn't come, and my friends and I, we thought that it was left at the loading dock, so we went in the room, and then it turned into an elevator, and then and then we dropped and then, next thing we know, I open my eyes, and we're in this wonderful facility.
But I swear to God, nobody knows about us, nobody saw us.
You could just let us go, all right? And I'm not gonna tell anybody about this, okay? Shit happens, life goes on.
And, uh ice ice cream.
Ice cream, okay? You guys know what ice cream is.
Everybody loves ice cream.
I don't know if you have Russian ice cream or if that's considered gelato.
I don't know what's what, but whatever you guys want, seriously.
USS Butterscotch, I mean, you gotta try it.
It is out of this world, I'm telling ya! [SOLDIERS LAUGHING] [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] I like this guy! "USS Butterscotch.
" [LAUGHS] [SOLDIERS CONTINUE LAUGHING] [CHUCKLES] [LAUGHTER STOPS] Who do you work for? Oh, come on.
No, no! No, seriously [SOLDIER GRUNTS] [SOLDIERS SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [GRUNTING] Get your hands off me! [YELPS, GRUNTS] Hey Steve? - [DOOR BUZZER SOUNDS] - Steve? Steve? Steve? What did you do to him? What did you do? - [OFFICER GRUNTS] - [ROBIN GROANS] [WHIMPERS] [IN RUSSIAN] Put them in the chairs.
[SOLDIER SPEAKS RUSSIAN] [ROBIN] Don't touch me! Steve [GRUNTS] Steve, wake up.
Steve? [ROBIN GRUNTS, YELPS] What did you do?! [ROBIN GRUNTS] Don't touch him.
[CLICKING TONGUE] Steve? Steve, can you hear me? your friend need a doctor.
Good thing we have the very best.
[OFFICER LAUGHS] [SOLDIERS LAUGH] You are going to regret that, little bitch.
[SPEAKS RUSSIAN] [DOOR BUZZER SOUNDS] Bastards.
Let us outta here! Bastards! Let us out! Let us out! [WATER SPLASHING GENTLY] [OMINOUS SYNTH MUSIC PLAYING] [STATIC HISSING] [MIKE] It can't be good for her to be in there for this long.
Mike, you need to relax.
What if she gets brain damage or something? Oh, shit.
Is that, like, a real thing? No, it's not.
He made it up.
Mike doesn't know what he's talking about.
- Oh, and you do? - No, I Yes, from The Hawkins Post.
I I called a couple days ago about the - [INDISTINCT MALE VOICE ON PHONE] - Yes, yes, um I was just following up to see if anything else had gone missing, or if Okay.
Um, sorry to bother [DIAL TONE SOUNDING] [MAX AND MIKE ARGUE INDISTINCTLY IN BACKGROUND] - [NANCY SIGHS] Who's next? - [JONATHAN] There is no next.
Unless you want to start calling random people's homes.
- It doesn't make sense.
- What part of any of this makes sense? There's a pattern, okay? A consistency to their behavior.
They've been feeding on these chemicals since this started, and and, what, they just stop, out of the blue? Maybe they have all the chemicals they need.
Maybe they've all turned into those things.
But what about the source? I mean, did the Mind Flayer just suddenly stop infecting people? And even if the flayed are monsters now, why can't El find them? Okay, can you guys settle an argument for us? Who do you think should decide El's limits? Mike or Eleven? The way that you frame that is such bullshit.
It's not bullshit, Mike.
This is your whole problem.
And it's also precisely the reason why she dumped your ass.
El dumped you? Yeah, because she is conspiring against me.
She's corrupting her.
No, enlightening her.
[MAX] The fact is, she's not yours.
She's her own person, fully capable of making her own decisions.
She's risking her life for no reason.
For no reason? Mike, the flayed are out there doing God knows what.
- Killing, flaying - Transforming into monsters.
And El's not stupid.
[NANCY] She knows her abilities better than any of us.
- Exactly, thank you.
- And she is her own person.
- Exactly.
- With her own free will.
[MAX] Exactly.
El has saved the world twice, and Mike still doesn't trust her.
You wanna talk about trust, really? After you made Eleven spy on us? - Wait, what? - Oh, she didn't tell you this? - No.
- Your girlfriend used El's powers - to spy on us.
- No, no, no, I did not make her.
It was her idea.
And why are we even talking about this, seriously? Yeah, who cares? - I care.
- Yeah.
I guess girlfriends don't lie, they spy.
We were just joking around.
Wouldn't it've been so funny if I was taking a massive shit or something? - You weren't.
- But what if I was? - Then gross! - Seriously, Mike? I'm just trying to demonstrate how careless Max is with Eleven's powers.
In fact, how careless all of you are.
You're treating her like some kind of machine when she's not a machine, and I don't want her to die looking for the flayed when they've obviously vanished off the face of the Earth.
So can we please just come up with a new plan because I love her and I can't lose her again.
[DOOR OPENING] What's going on? Nothing.
Nothing.
Just a family discussion.
Oh.
I found him.
Found who? [MURRAY] He calls it the key, and this key emits a great energy.
[ALEXEI SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [MURRAY] It requires much strength, power.
[ALEXEI SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [MURRAY] Those houses, like the one you found, they're located near, uh, transformers.
They're stealing from your town's power grid.
Why build this key here? Why are they not doing this in their own backyard? What are they trying to do, blow us to smithereens? [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [CHUCKLES LIGHTLY] [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] There were many of these, uh, keys before in Russia, but they turned out wrong.
[ALEXEI SPEAKING RUSSIAN] They had to come to where the where the, uh Where the what? - I don't understand what he's saying.
- I thought you were fluent.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are my free translation services not good enough for you? Because you can just go ahead and file your complaint right up my ass! What is Smirnoff doing? - He's showing me.
- [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [MURRAY] Oh, okay.
Uh, he says the straw, they're using it to penetrate a hole in a box? [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Okay, sorry, sorry.
[MURRAY] The straw represents the key, which emits a great energy.
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN] They're using this energy to break through a barrier, to open a doorway.
A doorway between worlds.
[ALEXEI SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [MURRAY] But it seems this key was only half the equation.
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Location Location was the other half.
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Oh, what [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] In Hawkins, this door had been opened once.
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN] It was still healing.
Jesus Christ.
So, this door is open now? [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] He says it is opening.
- [CREATURE SHRIEKING] - [FLUTTERING SOUND] [GASPS] - Where are you going? - To call our children.
[GASPS] [IN RUSSIAN] Can we watch Looney Tunes now? Nyet.
[BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYING] [PANTING] [GRUMBLING] - Can I help you with something? - Whiskey.
- You have whiskey? - No, but I do have vodka.
[HOPPER SIGHS] - [HOPPER INHALES SHARPLY] - Oh! If there's a way to start this key, there's gotta be a way to stop it, yeah? Turn it off? - [HOPPER INHALES SHARPLY] - [MURRAY SIGHS] - Right.
- Right? [IN RUSSIAN] The key, is there a way to turn it off? [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] he could turn it off.
Could Edison not turn off a lamp, could Bell not hang up a phone?" Cocky bastard.
"But" But what? [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] But he is now "naked".
Sorry, "exposed".
Compromised.
Hey, I will get you there.
I will get you to your key.
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [LAUGHS] You wanna ask him what the hell's so funny about that? [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] He says he likes your courage.
You remind him of a [CLEARS THROAT] fat Rambo.
[ALEXEI SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [MURRAY] But he says that even thin Rambo couldn't get there.
[ALEXEI SPEAKING RUSSIAN] This key, it is in an underground fortress designed by the greatest Russian minds, guarded by their greatest warriors.
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [MURRAY] Breaking in is impossible.
Jackpot.
[DUSTIN] Oh-ho-ho! Do you even know how to drive? How hard can it be? Max did it.
- [DUSTIN] Aw, come on.
- You seriously thought - they'd just leave keys in there? - There's gotta be a spare.
[ERICA SIGHS] - [ERICA] Hey, Dustin? - Yeah? How big did you say that Demogorgon was? Big.
Nine feet or so.
Why? Found 'em.
Erica? [LOUD ZAPPING] What the hell is that?! A deadly weapon.
Could be useful.
- For what? - What do you think? Taking down Commies, saving your friends.
Thought you were more realistic than that, nerd.
We don't even know where they are, and even if we did, there are a million guards up there with weapons way deadlier than that.
The best thing we can do for them is to get out of here and find help.
Easy with that.
Our chance of surviving, and theirs, rises substantially.
Just trust me on this.
Please? [ENGINE POWERING UP] [ROBIN] Help! [ROBIN'S VOICE ECHOES] Help! - Help! - Hey, would you stop yelling? Steve! Oh, my God! [PANTING] Steve Are Are you okay? My ears are ringing, and I can't really breathe, my eye feels like it's about to pop out of my skull, but, you know, apart from that, I'm doing pretty good.
Well, the good news is that they're calling you a doctor.
[ROBIN CHUCKLES] Is this his place of work? - I love the vibe.
- [ROBIN CHUCKLES] Charming.
Yeah, tell me about it.
So, okay, do you see that table over there to your right? No, your other right.
- Oh.
- Yeah, okay.
- And do you see those scissors? - Uh-huh.
Yeah, well, I think that if we move at the same time, we could get over there, and then maybe I could kick the table and knock them into your lap.
- And I could cut the binds.
- Yeah, and we could get out of here.
- Gotcha.
Okay, yeah, we can do that.
- Yeah.
Those morons.
They left scissors in here? - Yeah, morons.
[LAUGHS] - Total morons.
- Okay.
- Okay, so, on the count of three, we're gonna hop.
- Okay, good, hop on three.
I gotcha.
- All right.
One, two, three.
- Okay, that worked.
- Okay.
- All right.
Uh, let's try again.
- Right.
[BOTH] One, two, three.
- Holy shit, this is gonna work! - We're close.
Ready? Okay, one, two, three.
[BOTH GRUNTING] [BOTH GROANING] [LAUGHING LIGHTLY] It's okay, it's okay.
Don't cry.
Robin.
[ROBIN GIGGLES] Are you laughing? [CONTINUES LAUGHING] - Yeah.
- Jesus! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry.
It's just I can't believe I'm gonna die in a secret Russian base with Steve "The Hair" Harrington.
- It's just too trippy, man.
- We're not gonna die.
We're gonna get out of here, okay? Just You gotta let me just think for a second.
Do you remember, um, Mrs.
Click's sophomore history class? What? Mrs.
Clickity-Clackity.
That's what us band dweebs called her.
- [SIGHS] - It was first period, Tuesdays and Thursdays, so you were always late.
And you always had the same breakfast.
Bacon, egg, and cheese on a sesame bagel.
I sat behind you two days a week for a year.
Mister Funny.
Mister Cool.
The King of Hawkins High himself.
Do you even remember me from that class? [ROBIN CHUCKLES] Of course you don't.
You were a real asshole, you know that? Yeah, I know.
But it didn't even matter.
It didn't matter that you were an ass.
I was still obsessed with you.
Even though all of us losers pretend to be above it all, we still just wanna be popular accepted, normal.
If it makes you feel any better, having those things isn't all that great.
Seriously.
[SIGHS] It just baffles me.
Everything that people tell you is important, everything that people say you should care about, it's all just [CHUCKLES] bullshit.
But I guess you gotta mess up to figure things out, right? I hope so.
I feel like my whole life has been one big error.
[CHUCKLES] Yep.
[LAUGHS] At least it can't get any more messed up than this.
[BOTH CHUCKLE] You know, I wish I'd known you in Click's class.
- Yeah? - Really, I do.
[ROBIN CHUCKLES] Maybe you could've helped me pass the class.
Maybe instead of being here, I'd be on my way to college right now.
And I would have no idea that there were evil Russians beneath our feet, and I would be happily slinging ice cream with some other schmuck.
[BOTH CHUCKLE] Gotta say, though, I liked being your schmuck.
It was fun while it lasted.
It was.
- [BUZZER SOUNDS] - [DOOR OPENS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [CHUCKLES] Where were you two going? [CLICKING TONGUE] Try telling the truth this time, yes? It will make your visit with Dr.
Zharkov less painful.
[WINCES] [CHUCKLES] Wait a second.
Wait.
Hold on.
Okay! Wait, wait, wait! What is that thing? It will help you talk.
Did you even clean that thing?! [SCREAMS] [STATIC HISSING] [GASPING BREATHS] [ELEVEN BREATHES RAPIDLY] [GASPING, PANTING] What's he doing now? [NANCY] And that's not normal, right? Billy staying in his room on the Fourth of July? No, that's not normal.
He wants us to find him.
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.
If we go to Billy, then the rest of the flayed know where we are.
It's a trap, I agree.
We'll be ambushed.
We won't be surprised.
We'll know that they're coming, and we will kick their flayed butts.
You mean El will kick their butts.
[ELEVEN'S VOICE ECHOES] Papa! No.
[TERRY] Rainbow.
Three to the right, four to the left.
Sunflower.
Rainbow.
- [MIKE] It's too risky.
- [NANCY] Yeah, and unnecessary.
Killing the flayed won't stop the Mind Flayer.
We have to find out where it's spreading from.
We have to find the source.
[ELEVEN] Billy knows it.
Billy's been there.
To the source.
- Yeah, but - It's a trap.
I know.
[ELEVEN] We can't go to Billy, but I think there's another way.
A way for me to see where he's been.
[STATIC HISSING] El, I know you think you have to do this, but you don't.
It's just, you've only done this before once.
And your mom, she loved you, and wanted you to know what happened.
And Billy's mind is is sick, diseased.
The Mind Flayer is in him.
He can't hurt me.
Not in there.
We don't know that.
Mike.
I need you to trust me.
Yeah.
Just be careful.
[SHIVERING BREATHS] [ELEVEN EXHALES SHARPLY] [ECHOING] Billy.
Can you hear me? I want to see.
I want to see what happened.
[SUSPENSEFUL SYNTH MUSIC PLAYING] [WHIMPERING] Something's wrong.
[SCREAMS] Stop! No! No! No! No! [DISTORTED ROARING] [GASPING] [BILLY GRUNTING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [DISTORTED SCREAMS] [SQUAWKING] [DISTORTED WAILING] [MIKE, ECHOING] El, are you okay? Are you okay? [SIGHS] [SOFTLY] I'm okay.
What's going on? I'm on a beach.
[LUCAS] Okay, I may be dense, but the last I checked, there weren't any beaches in Hawkins.
What else do you see? [TIDES CRASHING] [SEAGULLS SQUAWKING] [ELEVEN] A woman.
She's pretty.
I I think she's looking at me.
[ECHOING LAUGHTER] [WOMAN] Woo! Yeah! [WOMAN LAUGHS] [WOMAN] You did it! There's a boy.
Did you see that? Yeah, I saw that! That was at least seven feet.
[WOMAN] I don't know what it was, but it almost gave me a heart attack.
Ten more minutes? - Yeah, okay, ten more minutes.
- Okay.
But any longer than that, Dad's gonna be mad, okay? [BOY] Okay! [BOY PANTING] Billy? Watch out for rip currents! I know.
It's Billy.
It's California.
It's a memory.
[SEAGULLS SQUAWKING] [DISTANT RUMBLING] I think I see it.
The source.
[PANTING] [OMINOUS SYNTH MUSIC PLAYING] [THUNDER RUMBLING AND CRASHING] [DIALING ON ROTARY PHONE] [MURRAY] Two minutes, Jim.
It's a secure line, but any longer than that and they could trace you.
Yeah, I want 'em to trace me.
- What? - [HOPPER CLEARS THROAT] [PHONE RINGING] Philadelphia Public Library.
Uh This is Jim Hopper uh police chief, Hawkins.
[HOPPER] I got this number from Dr.
Sam Owens.
What is your identification code? Identification code? You don't know it? You must be joking.
Oh, no, no, I got it, I got it.
[CHUCKLES] I got it.
You wrote it down and kept it in your wallet? "Antique Chariot".
Listen.
[HOPPER] Um, tell Owens that the Russkies are opening the gate.
Now, he'll know what that means.
Not about the Russkies, but about the gate.
Tell him that there's an entrance at Starcourt Mall.
I know how to get in, but I need backup, a lot of backup.
Have him call me back here at 618-625-8313.
Your message will be relayed.
- So, now what? - Now, we, uh we wait.
You compromised me, Jim.
You do realize that, don't you? I'm gonna have to relocate.
- How long do we wait? - As long as it takes.
How can you just sit there being calm? I am not calm! Our kids are in danger! You said they were at the festival! Which is, like, ten minutes from the gate! [SCOFFS] What are you doing? Joyce? What are you doing? [PHONE RINGS] Philadelphia Public Library.
Yes, hello.
Uh, this is, uh, Antique Chariot's partner Wheelbarrow.
I don't think Antique Chariot properly conveyed the urgency of our situation.
What are you doing? Can't just sit around and wait for a call.
- Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to stay calm.
- No.
Don't you dare patronize me! I don't know who you are, if you're some glorified secretary or what, but if you don't wanna lose your job, here's what's gonna happen.
When I hang up, you're gonna get up off your ass, and you're gonna go find Owens and tell him what's going on.
We don't have time to talk about it and neither does he.
He's gotta get to Hawkins, and he's gotta bring his men right now! Do you understand me? Yes, yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
And good day.
It's been exactly one minute, Joyce.
That's one minute too long.
- Alexei.
- [GASPS] [IN RUSSIAN] What's going on? We gotta go.

Back to Hawkins.
Come on.

What code? "The week is long.
The silver cat feeds when blue meets yellow in the west.
" Blah, blah, blah.
You broadcast that stupid spy shit all over town, and we picked it up on our Cerebro, and we cracked it in a day.
A day! You think you're so smart, but a couple of kids who scoop ice cream for a living cracked your code in a day, and now, people know you're here.
Who knows we are here, little bitch? Uh, well, Dustin knows.
Hey, Steve? - Yeah, Dustin Henderson, he knows.

Great hair.
Small.

Yeah.
Where is he? He's long gone, you big asshole.
And he's probably calling Hopper, and Hopper's calling the US cavalry.

[SPEAKING RUSSIAN] - Sorry, "keys".
Two keys.
- [ALEXEI SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Two-man rule.
- Two-man rule? - Yeah, two men, two keys, like a nuclear launch.
But, uh, to retrieve the keys, there is a vault.
- [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] - And to open the vault, you need to enter Planck's constant.
- Planck's what? - Planck's constant.
- It's a very famous number.
- All right, so we get the keys, and then we turn the machine off.
That's what he says.
All right, well, that shouldn't be too hard.
We can do this.
Joyce, did you hear the part where he said the place was like an impenetrable fortress? Yeah, but there has to be a way in.
Yeah, there is.
Our military.

So, why don't you two cut the horseshit and get to the part where you admit your sexual feelings for one another? - Whoa! - You are way off base, buddy! Oh, spare me, spare me, spare me! Yes, yes, he's a brute.
I know.
Probably reminds you of a bad relationship, and, gosh, you'd really like a nice man to settle down with, but, admit it, you're real curious to know what he's like in the sack.
And you.
Ha! Well, you're just a big manbaby who'd rather act tough than show his true feelings, because the last time you opened your heart, you got hurt.
Owie.
And now, rather than admit these feelings, you're dancing around one another with this mind-numbing and frankly boorish mating ritual.
So, please, for my sake, either quit your bickering, or pull over, tear off those clothes, and get it over with already! [GASPS] [DEEP SIGH] [IN RUSSIAN] What was that? [IN RUSSIAN] I told them they should have sex.

You're insane.
So, you prefer the original Thing? What? No, I'm not talking about The Thing, I'm talking about New Coke.
It's the same concept, dude.
Uh, actually, it's not the same concept.
It is the same concept.
- No, it's not.
- [YELLS] Yes, it is.
Hey.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Did you find him? [LUCAS] The movies? Dustin's so freaked out about the gate, he decides to go watch a movie? Yeah, makes total sense.
You're positive he said "gate" and not "great"? Yeah, like, "This movie I'm watching is great.
" Sounded like "gate".
Which would explain how the Mind Flayer's still alive.
- Yeah, we just have to shut it again.
- Then the monster dies.
But if not, we always have Lucas' fireworks.
Keep mocking my plan, Max.
Keep mocking it.
I wanna hear you say it again, because you keep doubting me.
You keep doubting me! - [MAX] Ridiculous.
- [LUCAS] Will? We're gonna prove 'em wrong, right? [EERIE SYNTH MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREECHING] [STEVE GROANS] The ceiling stopped spinning for me.
Is it still spinning for you? Holy shit.
No.
You think we puked it all up? Maybe.
Ask me something.
[IN RUSSIAN ACCENT] Interrogate me.
Okay.
Interrogate you.
Sure.
Um When was the last time you, uh, peed your pants? Today.
What? When the Russian doctor took out the bone saw.
[LAUGHS] Oh, my God.
It was just a little bit, though.
Yeah, it's definitely still in her system.
[LAUGHS] [GROANS] [ROBIN] Oh - All right, my turn.
- Okay.
Hit me.
Have you ever been in love? Yep.
Nancy Wheeler.
First semester, senior year.
[IMITATES GUNSHOT, CHUCKLES] Oh, my God.
She's such a priss.
[STEVE] Hm.
Turns out, not really.
[SCOFFS] Are you still in love with Nancy? - No.
- Why not? I think it's because I found someone who's a little bit better for me.
[CHUCKLES] It's crazy.
Ever since Dustin got home, he's been saying, "You know, you gotta find your Suzie.
You gotta find your Suzie.
" Wait, who's Suzie? It's some girl from camp, I guess his girlfriend.
To be honest with you, I'm not 100% sure she's even real.
But that's not that's not really the point.
That doesn't matter.
The point is, this girl, you know, the one that I like, it's somebody that I didn't even talk to in school.
And I don't even know why.
Maybe 'cause Tommy H.
would've made fun of me or I wouldn't be prom king.
It's stupid.
I mean, Dustin's right, it's all just a bunch of bullshit anyways.
Because, when I think about it, I should've been hanging out with this girl the whole time.
First of all, she's hilarious.
She's so funny.
I feel like, this summer, I have laughed harder than I have laughed in a really long time.
And she's smart.
Way smarter than me.
You know, she can crack, like, top secret Russian codes and You know? She's honestly unlike anyone I've ever even met before.
Robin? [TAPPING ON STALL] Robin, did you just OD in there? No.
[SIGHS] I am still alive.
[DEEP SIGH] [ROBIN] The floor's disgusting.
Yeah, well, I already got a bunch of blood and puke on my shirt, so What do you think? About? This girl.
She sounds awesome.
She is awesome.
And what about the guy? I think he's on drugs, and he's not thinking straight.
Really? 'Cause I think he's thinking a lot more clearly than usual.
He's not.
Look he doesn't even know this girl.
And if he did know her, like like really know her, I don't think he'd even want to be her friend.
No, that's not true.
No way is that true.
Listen to me, Steve.
It's shocked me to my core, but I like you.
I really like you.
But I'm not like your other friends.
And I'm not like Nancy Wheeler.
Robin, that's exactly why I like you.
[ROBIN SCOFFS] Do you remember what I said about Click's class? About me being jealous and, like, obsessed? Yeah.
It isn't because I had a crush on you.
It's because she wouldn't stop staring at you.
Mrs.
Click? [CHUCKLES] Tammy Thompson.
I wanted her to look at me.
But she couldn't pull her eyes away from you and your stupid hair.
And I didn't understand, because you would get bagel crumbs all over the floor.
And you asked dumb questions.
And you were a douchebag.
And And you didn't even like her and I would go home and just scream into my pillow.
But Tammy Thompson's a girl.
[SOFTLY] Steve.
Yeah? Oh.
Oh.
Holy shit.
Yeah.
Holy shit.
Steve did you OD over there? No, I just, uh just thinking.
Okay.
I mean, yeah.
Tammy Thompson, you know, she's cute and all, but I mean, she's a total dud.
She is not.
Yes, she is.
She wants to be, like, a singer.
She wants to move to, like, Nashville and shit.
- She has dreams.
- She can't even hold a tune.
She's practically tone-deaf.
Have you heard her? - [ROBIN CHUCKLES] - All the time.
[SINGING ATONALLY] You see me now tonight - Shut up.
- You see me - She does not sound like that.
- She sounds exactly - That's a great impersonation of her.
- She does not.
You sound like a Muppet.
She sounds like a Muppet.
She sounds like a Muppet giving birth.
[BOTH LAUGHING] [SINGS LIKE KERMIT] And if you could hold me tight [BOTH SING ATONALLY] We'll be holding on forever - Exactly.
- [LAUGHS] I know! Okay.
What the hell? [BOTH LAUGH] [INTENSE SYNTH MUSIC PLAYING] [CREATURE SHRIEKS WEAKLY] [MONSTROUS SCREECHING] [CHEERING AND LAUGHING] [ALEXEI, IN RUSSIAN] And why all this? If I just turn the keys, it's like turning off a car.
But then the car still works, does it not? [IN RUSSIAN] Yes.
And do you want the car to still work or do you want it to explode? I want the car to explode.
Good.
Then do this.
Just make sure you are nowhere near it when it does.
It is not pretty.
Turns people into dust.
And then It's over.
[CHUCKLES] And I become an American citizen and join in the fun, yes? Who said you had to be an American to join the fun? [CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD CHEERING] [IN RUSSIAN] It doesn't get more American than this, my friend.
Fatty foods, ugly decadence, rigged games [CHEERING] - They are rigged, these games? - [IN RUSSIAN] Yes.
[BALLOON POPS] They do not look rigged.
That's just it, my dear Alexei.
They have been designed to present the illusion of fairness! But it's all a scam, a trick, to put your money in the rich man's pocket.
That, my dear friend, is America.
But, hey knock yourself out.

[DUSTIN GRUNTS] - Lucas? - What are you doing here? Ask them.
It's their fault.
True, yeah.
Totally true.
It's absolutely our fault.
I don't understand what happened to that car.
El has superpowers.
- [ROBIN] I'm sorry? - Superpowers.
She threw it with her mind.
- C'mon, catch up.
- That's El? - Who's El? - I'm sorry, who are you? - I'm Robin.
I work with Steve.
- She cracked the top secret code.
Yeah, which is how we found out about the Russians.
Russians? Wait, what Russians? - The Russians! - Those were Russians? - Some of them.
- What are you talking about? - Didn't you hear our code red? - Yeah.
- Couldn't understand what you were saying.
- Goddamn low battery.
How many times do I have to tell you with the low battery? Well, everything worked out, didn't it? - Worked out? We almost died.
- Yeah, but we didn't, did we? - [STEVE] It was pretty damn close.
- [LUCAS] Okay, Russians? As in, they're working for the Russian government? - [ELEVEN PANTING] - [DUSTIN] What are you not comprehending? Am I not speaking English? - We have a full-blown Red Dawn situation.
- [DRONING SOUND] [MAX] So this has nothing to do with the gate? [DUSTIN] It has everything to do with the gate [DRONING SOUND INTENSIFIES] [ELEVEN GRUNTS, GROANS] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

----------
1 - Still nothing? - Nothing.
Food court? You sure they said food court? I'm sorry, have my translation skills been letting you down? We don't know it's your kids.
Yes, we do.
- What is that? - There's something in there.
- No! - Jesus Christ.
Keep her talking.
Keep her awake, okay? Jesus Christ.
Hey, hey, hey.
Stay awake, stay awake.
Let's get her on this side, on this side.
- Easy, easy, easy, easy.
- It's, uh You know, it's not actually that bad.
There was a The goalie on my soccer team, Beth Wildfire, this other girl slid into her leg, and the bone came out of her knee, - six inches or something, it was insane.
- Robin.
- Yeah? - You're not helping.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
All right, El? This is gonna hurt like hell, okay? - Okay.
- Need you to stay real still.
Here, you're gonna want to bite down on this, okay? Jesus Christ.
Holy shit.
Holy shit.
Do it.
Okay.
Oh, shit.
- Jonathan! - Stop talking! - Goddamn it! - No! Stop it! Stop! Stop! I can do it.
I can do it.
God! God! The Mind Flayer, it built this monster in Hawkins, to stop El, to kill her and pave a way into our world.
And it almost did.
That was just one tiny piece of it.
How big is this thing? It's big.
- Thirty feet, at least.
- Yeah.
It sorta destroyed your cabin.
Sorry.
Okay, so, just to be clear, this this big fleshy spider thing that hurt El, it's some kind of gigantic weapon? - Yes.
- But instead of, like, screws and metal, the Mind Flayer made its weapon with melted people.
- Yes, exactly.
- Yeah, okay.
I Yeah, I'm just making sure.
Are we sure this thing is still out there, still alive? El beat the shit out of it, but, yeah, it's still alive.
But if we close the gate again We cut the brain off from the body.
And kill it.
Theoretically.
Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo! Okay, this is what Alexei called "the hub".
Now, the hub takes us to the vault room.
Okay, where's the gate? Right here.
I don't know the scale on this, but I think it's fairly close to the vault room, maybe 50 feet or so.
More like 500.
What, you're just gonna waltz in there like it's commie Disneyland or something? I'm sorry, who are you? Erica Sinclair.
Who are you? Murray Bauman.
Listen, Mr.
Bunman, I'm not trying to tell you how to do things, but I've been down in that shithole for 24 hours.
And with all due respect, you do what this man tells you, you're all gonna die.
I'm sorry, why is this four-year-old speaking to me? Um, I'm ten, you bald bastard! - Erica! - Just the facts! She's right.
You're all gonna die, but you don't have to.
Excuse me.
- Sorry, may I? - Please.
Okay, see this room here? This is a storage facility.
There's a hatch in here that feeds into their underground ventilation system.
That will lead you to the base of the weapon.
It's a bit of a maze down there, but between me and Erica, we can show you the way.
You can show us the way? Don't worry, you can do all the fighting and the dangerous hero shit, and we'll just be your navigators.
No.
Nope.
Well, that settles it.
He's gonna die.
They're gonna die.
Yep, most likely.
You guys survived.
Barely.
We could've really used you guys down there.
Could've used you up here, too.
Yeah, man.
We missed you, dude.
Yeah.
Big-time.
I missed you guys, too.
Big-time.
Please don't cry, nerds.
- Erica.
- Keep saying my name, see what happens.
Hey, heads up.
You can navigate, just from someplace safe.
- It's not that simple.
- The signal won't reach.
Not with this.
You need something with a high enough frequency band to relay with the Russians' radio tower.
But for that to work, you need someone who has both seen their comms room and has access to a super-powered handcrafted radio tower, one preferably already situated at the highest point in Hawkins.
Oh, wait.
That's me.
If you want us to navigate, you got us.
But we need a head start.
And a car.
Oh, man, now this this is what I'm talkin' about! - "Toddfather"? - Oh, screw Todd! Steve's her daddy now.
Did you just talk about yourself in the third person? - Did he just call himself daddy? - All right, where are we going? - Weathertop.
- Weather-what? - Just drive.
- Okay.
Jesus! Bottom lock, second-to-top lock, third-to-top lock, top lock.
Listen to me, I need to end this, but I will be back before you know it, okay? - I don't know, Mom.
- No, listen.
You're gonna be safe there.
It's It's far away from all this.
You just stick close to your brother and and do whatever he says.
No matter what.
Okay? I'm not worried about me, Mom, I'm worried about you.
Oh, honey, I'm gonna be fine.
Okay? I'm gonna be fine.
Okay, Mom.
Okay, Mom.
That's enough.
- I'm gonna be fine.
- Okay.
Mom, I can't breathe.
- My battery's low, but - You're suffocating me.
it will recharge.
I know it will, kid.
I know.
I can fight.
Better than any of us.
But right now, I need you safe.
This thing is after you.
It's not after me.
Do you understand? Hey I need you to understand.
Okay? Hey.
We should probably go.
Mike? Be careful.
What? It's a two-man operation.
Two! - Yeah, well, change of plans.
- Change of plans? Yeah.
Will you explain it to him, please? We have two options here, Jim.
We can turn the machine off, or we can explode it.
- Oh, yeah, says who? - Says the man who built it! - Yeah, and we wanna explode it! - Or else our heroic efforts will be for naught! This is a three-man operation, Jim, not two.
Yeah, three.
El, you're bleeding.
Are you okay? Yeah.
- Here.
- Okay.
Here.
Lay down.
- What's wrong? - I don't I don't know.
You can't be serious.
Come on! Didn't your mom just buy this car? Yes.
I'm sure it's fine.
- Did you leave the lights on? - No.
- Do we have gas? - Yes! - Come on! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Just stop, stop! Pop the hood.
- What the hell? - What? The ignition cable's gone.
Back in the mall! Back in the mall! - Go! Go, go, go! - Be careful! Go! Go! Go, go, go! So then I yank those cables like I'm pulling weeds.
- And that'll set off the alarm - According to Alexei, may his soul rest in peace.
Which should give you two an opening to retrieve the keys from the vault.
And then we just follow the map to the observation room, turn the key - Kaboom, we blow this sucker sky-high.
- Yeah.
And then, once the rift is closed, we escape back through the vents.
Right under their commie noses.
Then home free.
Uh Oh, God, just because it wasn't your plan doesn't mean it was a bad plan.
I didn't say it was a bad plan.
You made a noise.
- I did not make a noise.
- You did too.
I really think it's disrespectful What is up with you and noises? Children! Children! It is a good plan.
A solid B, which is laudable, given the situation and time constraints.
Dare I say, if it all goes right they'll never even know we were here.
Stop right there! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Documents, important documents for the Lieutenant-Comrade! He called us, last minute.
Pardon our sloppy appearance.
Lieutenant? What Lieutenant? Lieutenant Molotov? Oh, shit.
Jim This is crazy.
- Oh, my God.
- Jim, I This I had it under control.
Yeah, sure you did.
What are you doing? I'm improvising.
Your love Liftin' me higher Jesus, how far is this place, man? Relax, we're almost there.
Suzie must be pretty special, huh? I mean, if you built this thing and lugged it all the way to the middle of nowhere just to talk to her? I mean, nobody's scientifically perfect, but Suzie's about as close to being perfect as any human could possibly be.
She sound made-up to me.
She sound made-up to you? - Why are you hesitating, Steve? - I'm I'm I'm not! I'm not! I think she sounds real.
You know, totally, absolutely real.
Left.
Turn left.
- There's not a road here.
- Turn left now! Jesus! Hang on! Higher and higher Whoa! Henderson, where are we going?! Up! Whoa! Liftin' me higher - Oh, Jesus! - We're not gonna make it! Yes, we are.
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby! Come on! Come on.
Come on.
Come on! Guess the Toddfather has its limitations.
Scoops Troop, do you copy? Scoops Troop, do you copy? Scoops Troop, do you copy? Scoops Troop, I repeat, do you copy? We're trapped in the mall and in need of emergency transportation.
Scoops Troop, do you copy? Billy has found us.
He has disabled our car and we are trapped in the mall.
Repeat: Billy has disabled our car and we are trapped in the mall.
- Scoops Troop - You're gonna kill him, aren't you? This is just a precaution, okay? And not just against Billy.
If he knows we're here, so does the Mind Flayer.
Scoops Troop, I repeat, we are in need of emergency transportation.
Do you copy? Scoops Troop, do you copy? No chance that thing'll drive, right? - Steve, do you copy? - We don't need it to drive.
Dustin! We just need the ignition cable.
Push! Shit! Let me try.
El I can do it.
Can I help? Picking up.
Do I know you? New arrivals.
Landed last night.
Say goodbye to sunlight.
Who needs sunlight when we have one another, comrade? Indeed, comrade! And a bottle of Stolichnaya.
Why are you talking so much? He was nice.
- He was nice? - He was a nice guard.
Yeah, I mean, we should probably invite him over after all this is done.
Yeah, I can bake him a casserole.
Get a six-pack, share some laughs.
You know, have a drink.
Ugh.
Anyone wanna trade jobs? Bald Eagle, do you copy? Bald Eagle, I repeat, this is Scoops Troop, do you copy? Yes, I copy.
Call sign? Bald Eagle.
Please repeat.

This is Bald Eagle! - Copy that.
Good to hear your voice, Bald Eagle.
What's your 20? We reached the vent.
I'll contact you when I need you.
Until then, silence.
Roger that, Bald Eagle.
This is Scoops Troop, going radio silent.
10-10, over.
I hate children.
- Remember, if anyone says anything, just - Smile and nod.
Good luck.
Push! All right, great.
All right, now, all the way.
Ready? Three, two, one Push! Told you.
Physics.
How do we get it open? Uh, there should be a latch.
Check under the wheel.
- You see it? - I don't know, hold on.
What's she doing? El.
Are you okay? - Do you see it? - I don't know.
It should be right here.
Distributor, distributor Mike.
Got it.
Nancy! Come on! We just found them like this.
The American.
It's taking too long.
- It's fine.
- No, it's not.
It is not.
She could've died back there.
She almost did.
Well, she's safe now.
She's on her way to Murray's.
That thing won't find her, not before we kill it.
Hey.
This isn't the way this is supposed to work, all right? You're supposed to say, "Yes, I told you so.
That's why we needed to go back to the kids.
" Oh, yeah, and then you say something like "Yeah, well, it's really hard to listen when you make everything sound like it's the end of the goddamn world.
" You know I think, despite everything, I mean, despite the arguing, I think we make a pretty good team.
Well, we made it this far, didn't we? Yeah.
We did.
We did.
So, uh did I get the job or what? Ah, come on.
Detective Byers.
It has a ring, doesn't it? It's kinda hard to serve in a town where you don't live, Detective.
You're still moving outta here.
I mean, that is the plan, right? Eh, we'll see how it goes.
"How it goes"? How what goes? You know, if if we actually do make it out of here, we we deserve to celebrate, right? Yeah.
I mean yes.
Absolutely.
I hear Enzo's is pretty good.

Scoops Troop, this is Hm.
Bald Eagle.
I've reached another junction.

All right, so if memory serves, this is right after the My Little Pony thesis.
- We went left, so he has to go right.
- Right.
Fly right, Bald Eagle.
- Fly right.
- Roger that, flying right.
Little shit.
What's the My Little Pony thesis? Don't get him started.
- Get him started? Just tell me - Hey, guys? Griswold Family, this is Scoops Troop! Do you copy? Over! Griswold Family, I repeat, this is Scoops Troop.
Do you Griswold Family, do you copy? Do you copy?! Griswold Family, this is Scoops Troop.

Got it.
Bald Eagle, this is Scoops Troop.
What's your 20? I told you, radio silence! Yeah, but we have a problem.
What kind of problem? It's turned away.
If we go up the stairs now, we'll make it.
- No way, not with El's leg.
- We have to try.
There's another way to get out.
Through the Gap.
Okay.
Now.
Bald Eagle has landed.
Repeat.
Bald Eagle has landed.
Okay.
Come on, how much longer? I don't know, I've never done this before! Okay.
Okay, okay! Get ready, lovebirds, you're almost up to bat.
Oh, shit.

Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Let's go.
Let's go.
Did Mikhail send for you? - All right.
- Okay.
- Give me the code.
- Okay.
Six-six-two, six-oh-eight, oh-oh-four.
Uh again? Six-six-two, six-oh-eight, oh-oh-four.
Murray? Your goddamn code is wrong.
What? Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure.
Well, I I suppose it could be wrong.
How could it be wrong? The code is a number, a famous number.
Planck's constant I I thought I knew it.
Planck's constant.
- You know it? - Not by heart.
You? I'm not a nerd, nerd.
He told me it was Planck's constant, which I know.
Why would I need him to give me a number I already know? What are you doing? Go, go, go! - Shit.
- Get the car started.
Go! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Come on.
- Come on.
- We gotta go! Come on! We gotta go! Are you okay? Ask me tomorrow? Oh, shit! Get in! - Go, go, go, go! - Go, go, go! Suzie, do you copy? Suzie, do you copy? Suzie, do you copy? This is Suzie.
I copy.
- Suzie! - Dusty-bun? "Dusty-bun"? Where have you been? I'm so, so sorry.
I I've been really busy uh, trying to save the world from Russians and monsters.
Of course you have.
Get the goddamn number already! Who was that? It was Uh, I don't know, actually.
I think it was just some interference.
So, why don't we, uh, change frequency to 14.
158? Copy that, shifting frequency.
Standby.
- Dusty-bun, you copy? - I copy, Suzie-poo.
It sounds much better now, thanks.
- Suzie.
- Okay, so, listen, do you know Planck's constant? Do you know the Earth orbits the sun? Okay, so I know it starts with two sixes, and then a W-What is it? Okay, let me just be clear on this.
I haven't heard from you in a week, and now you want a mathematical equation that you should know so you can save the world? Suzie-poo, I promise, I will make it up to you as soon as possible.
You can make it up to me now.
- What? - I want to hear it.
- Not right now.
- Yes, now, Dusty-bun.
Suzie-poo, this is urgent.
Yes, yes, you're saving the world, I heard you the first time, but Ged is also saving Earthsea and he's about to confront the shadow, so this is Suzie, signing off.
Wait, wait, wait! Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Shit.

Gosh, I miss you, Dusty-bun.
And I miss you more, Suzie-poo.
I miss you more, multiplied by all the stars in our galaxy.

But then on July Fourth, everything changed.
A terrible tragedy struck this small town.
But this was not this small town's first brush with tragedy.
Mysterious deaths, government cover-ups, a bizarre chemical leak.
Is it all linked? All a vast conspiracy? The fault of a disgraced, corrupt mayor? Or is something more going on in the heartland? Can a town itself be cursed? Some believe a rise in Satanism is to blame.
To find out, tune in tonight at 8:00 p.
m.
for "Horror in the Heartland" on Cutting Edge.
You put your mom down as a reference? Yeah.
Why not? She's, like, super well-respected.
You're such a dingus.
Wha Uh, just to be clear, we weren't fired, you know.
The mall burned down and, like, killed a bunch of people.
Thanks for sharing.
Didn't know.
Three favorite movies.
Go.
Uh The Apartment, Hidden Fortress, Children of Paradise.
You, go.
- Favorite movies? - Did I stutter? Uh Animal House, for sure.

A New Hope? A new what-now? Which Star Wars? - The one with the teddy bears.
- Duh.
No? Uh Oh, the one that just came out.
The movie that just came out.
The one with the DeLorean and Alex P.
Keaton, and he's trying to bang his mom.
The time Yeah, those are my top three.
Classics.
You start Monday.
You start never.
Will you just, um Will you give us a minute? Why? Steve.
All right, you have to understand, Keith, I know his taste is a bit pedestrian, but the dingus has other qualities.
He's a douchebag of the highest order, Robin.
He was a bit of a prick to us in high school, I'll grant you that, but he remains a total chick magnet.
Yeah, okay, and this is relevant to me how? Uh, Earth to Keith.
The ladies will come in just to see him.
They'll come in in droves.
Droves, Keith.
We sold so much ice cream, they had to get a second shipment in from Michigan.
Goddamn Michigan, Keith.
And these ladies These ladies are hot.
They're so very hot.
And there are too many of them for little Steve.
He needs assistance.
He needs your assistance, Keith.
What's in it for you? You got a thing for him or something? Goddammit.
This is Hm.
We're just, um We're just friends.
Oh! Fast Times.
Fast Times.
Ever heard of it? Top three for me, Keith.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down.
- Sorry.
Sorry.
- Still got it? - Yeah, yeah.
Turn around Look at what you see In her face The mirror of your dreams Rhymes that keep their secrets Will unfold behind the clouds Wait, did we get that verse right? It's "unfold behind the clouds"? Yeah, but you're butchering it, so could you please stop? So then join in, Dusty-bun.
Yeah, come on, Dusty-bun, why don't you join us? You guys are so funny, you should be on Carson.
- Can't we just hear your rendition? - No.
Please? Just one verse? No.
No way.
It's reserved for Suzie's ears and Suzie's ears alone.
Turn around Look at what you see In their face The mirror of your dreams Shut up, you guys.
Rhymes that keep their secrets Stop! You guys, please, shut up.
Whoa, dude.
That's the donation box.
I know.
I'll just use yours when I come back.
I mean, if we still wanna play.
Yeah, but what if you want to join another party? Not possible.
Is that everything? I guess so.
Seventeen years of my life packed up in one day.
What if I just don't let you go? I think the new owners might kick us out.
You could stay in our basement.
Your dad'd love that.
We could hide you in a tent, like El.
Hey.
It's gonna be okay.
As a wise man once said we've got shared trauma.
So what's a little more, right? What's a little more? They'll come back.
I know they will.
Thanks.
- You packed your walkie, right? - Yes.
Because you know that I'm gonna steal Cerebro from Dustin and call you so much, you're gonna have to turn it off, right? Did you talk to your mom? About Thanksgiving? Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got the okay.
I'll be there.
And then I was thinking maybe you could come up here for Christmas.
And Will, too.
You can come before or after Christmas, or whatever Mrs.
Byers wants, but I was thinking Christmas Day could be super fun, because we'd all have cool new presents to play with and, uh Sorry, that made me sound like a seven-year-old.
I like presents, too.
Yeah, cool.
Yeah.
I like I like presents, too.
Cool.
Mike? Yeah? Remember that day at the cabin, you were talking to Max? Um I don't think I follow.
You talked about your your feelings, your heart.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, that.
Man, that was so long ago.
Um That was really heat of the moment stuff, and we were arguing and I don't really remember What did I say, exactly? Mike I love you, too.
Donation box? Uh, yeah, sure.
What is that? Uh It It's the speech Hop wrote for you and Mike.
Speech? Yeah.
You know, the heart-to-heart.
He never talked to you, did he? Can I read? "There's something I've been wanting to talk to you both about.
" I know this is a difficult conversation, but I care about you both very much.
And I know that you care about each other very much.
And that's why it's important that we set these boundaries moving forward, so we can build an environment where we all feel comfortable trusted and open "to sharing our feelings.
" Feelings.
Feelings.
Jesus.
The truth is, for so long, I'd forgotten what those even were.
I've been stuck in one place, in a cave, you might say.
A deep, dark cave.
And then, I left some Eggos out in the woods, and you came into my life and for the first time in a long time, I started to feel things again.
I started to feel happy.
But, lately, I guess I've been feeling distant from you.
Like you're you're pulling away from me or something.
I miss playing board games every night, making triple-decker Eggo extravaganzas at sunrise, watching westerns together before we doze off.
But I know you're getting older.
Growing.
Changing.
And I guess if I'm being really honest, that's what scares me.
I don't want things to change.
So, I think maybe that's why I came in here, to try to maybe stop that change.
To turn back the clock.
To make things go back to how they were.
But I know that's naive.
It's just not how life works.
It's moving.
Always moving, whether you like it or not.
And, yeah, sometimes it's painful.
Sometimes it's sad.
And sometimes it's surprising.
Happy.
So, you know what? Keep on growing up, kid.
Don't let me stop you.
Make mistakes, learn from 'em, and when life hurts you, because it will, remember the hurt.
The hurt is good.
It means you're out of that cave.
But, please, if you don't mind, for the sake of your poor old dad, keep the door open three inches.
I I will be king Are you okay? Yeah.
Time to go? Yeah.
I'll be out in a minute.
Okay.
Oh, we could be heroes Just for one day Oh, we can be us Just for one day I I can remember Standing Standing by the wall And the guns Shot above our heads Oh, we can be heroes Just for one day No.
Not the American.
No, I'm begging you No! Don't! No! Please! No! Don't! No, don't! Don't do this! Let me go! Let me go! Don't leave me in here.
Let me out, I'm innocent.
I'm innocent! I'm begging you, please!
