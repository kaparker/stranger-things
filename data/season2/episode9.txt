1 Eleven.
Mike.
[GASPS] Is that I never gave up on you.
I called you every night.
Every night for 353 days.
I heard.
Why didn't you tell me you were there? - That you were okay? - [HOPPER] Because I wouldn't let her.
- The hell is this? Where you been? - Where have you been? You've been hiding her.
- You've been hiding her this whole time! - Hey! Let's talk.
Alone.
- Protecting her! Protecting her? - Listen.
Listen to me.
The more people know about her, the more danger she's in.
And the more danger you and your family are in So I should be thanking you? I'm not asking you to thank me! I'm asking you to try to understand.
I don't! I don't understand! That's fine.
That's fine! Just do not blame her! All right? She's upset enough as it is.
I don't blame her! I blame you! I blame you! That's okay, kid.
That's okay.
No! Nothing about this is okay! - Nothing about this is okay! - Oh, jeez You're a stupid, disgusting, - lying piece of shit! - Okay.
All right! Stop it.
- Liar! Liar! Liar! - Stop it.
It's okay.
- Stop it! Stop it! - [CRYING] Liar! Liar! You're okay, kid.
You're okay.
I'm sorry, kid.
- [LUCAS] We missed you.
- I missed you, too.
[DUSTIN] We talked about you pretty much every day.
Teeth.
- What? - You have teeth.
Oh.
You like these pearls? [PURRS] [MAX] Eleven? Hey.
Um, I'm Max.
I've heard a lot about you.
- [SIGHS] Hey.
Hey, sweetheart.
- [CRIES] [SNIFFLES] Hey.
Can I see him? [SIGHS] He's not doing well.
I know.
I saw.
What else did you see? You opened this gate before, right? Yes.
Do you think if we got you back there, that you could close it? [ROARS AND SCREECHES] [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] Memories Light the corners of my mind [DOORBELL RINGS] Misty water-colored memories - [DOORBELL RINGS] - Of the way we were Ted! Would you please get that? [SNORING] [DOORBELL CONTINUES RINGING] - [DOORBELL CONTINUES RINGING] - Ted! Of the smiles we left behind [DOORBELL RINGING RAPIDLY] Hold on, please.
- Oh.
Hi.
- Hi.
I, uh, didn't realize Nancy had a sister.
[CHUCKLES] What's so funny? I'm Nancy's mother.
- No.
- Yes.
[CHUCKLES] Mrs.
Wheeler.
[STAMMERS] Um, I'm sorry, and you are? Billy.
Billy Hargrove.
You must be here for Nancy.
Nancy? No, no, no.
Not my type.
Uh No, actually, I am looking for my little sister Max.
Goes by Maxine.
She's been missing all day, and, uh, to be honest with you, - I've been worried sick, you know, so - Oh.
I thought she was at Lucas', but Mrs.
Sinclair said your house is the the designated hangout, so, you know Here I am.
Their driveway is pretty dark this time of night.
So drive slowly.
Always.
And when you see Mike, tell him to come home already, okay? You're a real lifesaver, you know that? Anytime.
I'll see you later.
Do believe that I'm falling in love Hmm.
Do believe that I'm falling in love Do believe it Do believe that I'm falling in love [HOPPER SIGHS] It's not like it was before.
It's grown.
A lot.
And, I mean, that's considering we can get in there.
The place is crawling with those dogs.
Demo-dogs.
- [SIGHS] I'm sorry, what? - I said, uh, Demo-dogs.
Like Demogorgon and dogs.
You put them together, it sounds pretty badass How is this important right now? It's not.
I'm sorry.
I can do it.
You're not hearing me.
I'm hearing you.
I can do it.
Even if El can, there's still another problem.
- If the brain dies, the body dies.
- I thought that was the whole point.
It is, but if we're really right about this I mean, if El closes the gate and kills the mind flayer's army Will's a part of that army.
Closing the gate will kill him.
- [JOYCE] He likes it cold.
- [HOPPER] What? It's what Will kept saying to me.
He likes it cold.
We keep giving it what it wants.
If this is a virus, and Will's the host, then Then we need to make the host uninhabitable.
[NANCY] So if he likes it cold We need to burn it out of him.
We have to do it somewhere he doesn't know this time.
Yeah, somewhere far away.
Take Denfield, then you'll see a large oak tree.
You're gonna swing a right.
That road is gonna dead-end.
And it's about a five-minute walk from there.
[PANTING] Okay.
Denfield to oak tree.
Swing a right.
That's it.
But it's channel ten, right? It's channel ten.
Listen You let me know when that thing is out of him.
You should go with him.
- What? - With Jonathan.
No, I'm [SCOFFS] I'm not just gonna leave Mike.
No one's leaving anyone.
I may be a pretty shitty boyfriend, but turns out I'm actually a pretty damn good babysitter.
Steve It's okay, Nance.
It's okay.
I Just be careful, okay? I can't lose you again.
You won't lose me.
Do you promise? Promise.
El Come on, let's go.
It's time.
[SIGHS DEEPLY] Okay.
[ENGINE STARTS] So, what, we're just not gonna talk about it, huh? About what? Oh, I don't know.
I'm just curious, you know, why all of a sudden you look like some kind of MTV punk.
I'm not mad, kid.
I just want to know where you've been.
That's all.
To see Mama.
Okay.
- How'd you get there? - A truck.
A truck? A big truck.
A big truck? Whose truck was it? - A man's.
- A man's? A nice man.
Okay.
So let me just get this straight in my head.
So a nice man in a big truck, he drove you to your mama's, and then what? Your Aunt Becky gave you those clothes and that makeup? I I shouldn't have left.
Mmm-mmm.
No.
No, this isn't on you, kid.
I should've been there.
I should never have lied to you about your mom.
Or about when you could leave.
A lot of things I shouldn't have done.
Sometimes I feel like I'm [INHALES SHARPLY] Like I'm just some kind of black hole or something.
[SIGHS] A black hole? Yeah, it's a You know, it's this thing in outer space.
It's like, it sucks everything towards it and destroys it.
Sarah had a picture book about outer space.
She loved it.
Who's Sarah? Sarah? Sarah's my girl.
She's my little girl.
Where is she? Well, that's kind of the thing, kid.
She, uh She left us.
- Gone.
- Yeah.
The black hole.
It got her.
And somehow I've just been scared, you know? I've just been scared that it would take you, too.
I think that's why I get so mad.
I'm so sorry.
For everything.
I could be so so Stupid? [CHUCKLING] Yeah.
Stupid.
- [CHUCKLES] - Just really stupid.
I've been stupid, too.
I guess we broke our rule.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY] I don't hate it, by the way.
This whole look.
It's kinda cool.
Bitchin'.
Okay.
Sure.
- Bitchin'.
- [CHUCKLES AND SNIFFLES] [MONSTER ROARING IN DISTANCE] All right.
[SIGHS] It should fit now.
Is this really necessary? Yes, it is, okay? This is a ground-breaking scientific discovery.
We can't just bury it like some common mammal, okay? It's not a dog.
All right, all right, all right.
But you're explaining this to Mrs.
Byers, all right? Christ.
Help me out.
- What am I supposed to do? - Get the door, man.
All right, I got the door.
- Ew.
Jesus - God [PANTING] Phew! Mike, would you just stop already? You weren't in there, okay, Lucas? That lab is swarming with hundreds of those dogs.
Demo-dogs! - [LUCAS] The chief will take care of her.
Like she needs protection.
Listen, dude, a coach calls a play in a game, bottom line, you execute it.
All right? Okay, first of all, this isn't some stupid sports game.
And second, we're not even in the game.
We're on the bench.
[STAMMERS] So my point is Right, yeah, we're on the bench, so, uh, there's nothing we can do.
That's not entirely true.
I mean, these Demo-dogs, they have a hive mind.
When they ran away from the bus, they were called away.
- If we get their attention - Maybe we can draw them from the lab.
Clear a path to the gate.
Yeah, and then we all die.
That's one point of view.
No, that's not a point of view, man.
That's a fact.
I got it! This is where the chief dug his hole.
This is our way into the tunnel.
So Here, right here.
This is like a hub.
So you got all the tunnels feeding in here.
Maybe if we set this on fire Oh, yeah? That's a no.
- The mind flayer would call away his army.
- They'd all come to stop us.
- We circle back to the exit.
- Guys.
- By the time they realize we're gone - El would be at the gate.
Hey.
Hey! Hey! This is not happening.
- But - No, no, no, no, no.
No buts.
I promised I'd keep you shitheads safe, and that's exactly what I plan on.
We're staying here.
On the bench.
And we're waiting for the starting team to do their job.
Does everybody understand? This isn't a stupid sports game.
I said does everybody understand that? I need a yes.
[ENGINE REVVING] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR RADIO] [MAX] It's my brother.
He can't know I'm here.
He'll kill me.
He'll kill us.
[TIRES SCREECH] [MUSIC STOPS PLAYING] Am I dreaming, or is that you, Harrington? Yeah, it's me.
Don't cream your pants.
- [CAR DOOR SLAMS] - What are you doing here, amigo? I could ask you the same thing.
Amigo.
Looking for my stepsister.
A little birdie told me she was here.
Huh, that's weird.
I don't know her.
Small? Redhead? Bit of a bitch.
Doesn't ring a bell.
Sorry, buddy.
[SIGHS] You know, I don't know, this [CLICKS TONGUE] This whole situation, Harrington, I don't know.
It's giving me the heebie-jeebies.
Oh, yeah? Why's that? My 13-year-old sister goes missing all day.
And then I find her with you in a stranger's house.
And you lie to me about it.
[CHUCKLES] Man, were you dropped too much as a child, or what? I don't know what you don't understand about what I just said.
She's not here.
Then who is that? [EXCLAIMS] Shit! Did he see us? Oh, shit.
Listen - I told you to plant your feet.
- [GROANS] Well, well, well.
Lucas Sinclair.
What a surprise.
I thought I told you to stay away from him, Max.
- Billy, go away.
- You disobeyed me.
And you know what happens when you disobey me.
- Billy - I break things.
[GRUNTS] - [INDISTINCT YELLING] - Billy! Stop! Billy! Stop! Get off of me, you Since Maxine won't listen to me, maybe you will.
You stay away from her.
Stay away from her! You hear me? - I said get off me! - [GROANS] So dead, Sinclair! You're dead.
No.
You are.
- [GROANS] - [CHUCKLES] Steve! [LAUGHING] Looks like you got some fire in you after all, huh? I've been waiting to meet this King Steve everybody's been telling me so much about.
Get out.
- Yes! Kick his ass, Steve! - [MIKE] Get him! [DUSTIN] Murder the son of a bitch! - [DUSTIN] Now!

It's actually kinda nice.
We'll do it here.
Are you sure this is a good idea? This thing has had Will long enough.
Let's kill the son of a bitch.
[HOPPER GRUNTS] [MONSTERS GROWLING] - [SNARLS] - Papa! [SCREAMS] All right.

He kicked your ass, but you put up a fight.
- You're okay.
- [GROANS] [LUCAS] Okay, you're gonna keep straight for a half a mile, then make a left on Mount Sinai.
[STEVE] What's going on? Oh, my God! Just relax.
She's driven before.
- Yeah, in a parking lot.

They were gonna leave you behind.
Oh, my God.
I promised that you'd be cool, okay? [STEVE] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Hey, where do you think you're going? What are you, deaf? Hello? We are not going down there right now.
I made myself clear.
Hey, there's no chance we're going to that hole, all right? This ends right now! [DUSTIN] Steve, you're upset, I get it.
But the bottom line is, a party member requires assistance, and it is our duty to provide that assistance.
Now, I know you promised Nance that you would keep us safe.
So, keep us safe.
[SIGHS] [STEVE GRUNTS] Holy shit.
[MIKE] Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's this way.
[DUSTIN] You're pretty sure, or you're certain? [MIKE] I'm 100% sure.
Just follow me and you'll know.
[STEVE] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Maybe when this is all said and done, maybe you could help her out, too, you know? Maybe you could help her lead, like, a normal life.
One where she's not poked and prodded and treated like some kind of lab rat, you know? I don't know, just a thought.
[GROANS] But, uh think about it.
Don't go anywhere.

[HOPPER PANTING] [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [REPORTER] Since the release of the incendiary tape, the once quiet town of Hawkins, Indiana, has spent time in a place it never expected.
The national spotlight.
[CHUCKLES] [REPORTER] Under mounting pressure, several high-ranking members from the U.
S.
Department of Energy have admitted involvement in the death and cover-up of Hawkins resident Barbara Holland who died due to exposure to an experimental chemical asphyxiant, which had leaked from the grounds of the lab.
We sent our own April Kline to Hawkins to speak to residents, residents who told us they thought they lived in a safe town.
The kind of town where, they say, nothing ever happens.
Chief-o.
- How's the leg? - Better.
Pretty sure my football career is over.
[BOTH CHUCKLE LIGHTLY] Want some? No way I'm gonna finish it.
No.
I'm, uh on a diet.
Well, you're a better man than me.
- Hey, got a little something for you.
- [HOPPER SIGHS] I thought Sometimes I impress even myself.
Still, I'd let things cool off for a while, if I were you.
How long is a while? [SNIFFLES] Want to be safe? I give it a year.
A year? What about one night out? One night? Yeah.
How risky would that be? What's so important about one night? Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time [JOYCE] Yeah, you got it.

[INHALES SHARPLY] [COUGHS] How are you holding up? - You know.
- Yeah.
That feeling never goes away.
It is true what they say, you know.
