[ELEVEN BREATHING HEAVILY] [SOLDIERS CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY] [GRUNTS] [PANTING] [KAREN] What about the Russians? What if they come looking for her? They don't know where she is.
And she can't contact you without us knowing.
[MAN] The most important thing is for you to try to go on with your lives - and to keep all of this - Top secret.
Yeah.
Understood.
We're all patriots in this house.
- [WOMAN] Go back to the beginning.
- [MIKE] I told you everything.
- I understand this is difficult, Michael.
- I don't know where she is.
And even if I did, I'd never tell you.
I would never tell you.
[WOMAN] I know it's difficult to accept, the stories she told you were not true.
She's a very dangerous individual.
[MAN] If she contacts you, you must tell us.
[WOMAN] Otherwise, you're putting yourself and your entire family at risk.
Do you understand, Michael? Do you understand? [MAN] Michael? Michael? [MAN] Fan out.
Somebody check the left side, I'll check the right side.
[HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [HOPPER] Oh, Jesus! [ELEVEN] Ghost.
Yeah, I see that.
- [ELEVEN] Halloween.
- Sure is.
But right now, it's breakfast, okay? Come on, let's eat.
They wouldn't see me.
- Who wouldnât see you? - The bad men.
What are you talking about? Trick or treat.
You want to go trick-or-treating? You know the rules.
- Yes, but - Yeah, so you know the answer.
- No, but they wouldn't see me.
- No.
Hey.
I don't care.
- But they wouldnât see me.
- I don't care, all right? You go out there, ghost or not, it's a risk.
We don't take risks.
All right? They're stupid, and We're not stupid! Exactly.
Now, you take that off, sit down and eat.
Your food's getting cold.
[SIGHS] All right, look How about I get off early tonight, and I buy us a bunch of candy, and we can sit around and get fat, and we watch a scary movie together? How's that for a compromise? [STUTTERS] "Compromise"? C-O-M-promise.
Compromise.
How about that's your word for the day? Yeah? It's something that's kinda in-between.
It's like halfway happy.
By 5-1-5? 5:15.
Yeah, sure.
Promise? Yes.
I promise.
Halfway happy.
[CHUCKLES] Will? Come on, honey, up and at 'em.
Will? - Jonathan? - Yeah? Where's Will? - What? - Where's Will? - He's not in his room? - No.
Uh Will? What are you doing? Peeing? [CHUCKLES] Okay.
[TOILET FLUSHES] Okay.
- Let's get this on.
- [GRUNTS] Oh! You need some tape.
Hold on.
What's this? Nothing.
Did you have another episode? No, it's just, um a sketch for a story I'm writing.
[JOYCE SIGHS] All right.
[JONATHAN] Three, two, one - ["GHOSTBUSTERS" PLAYING] - Great.
Hold up the proton blaster.
All right, now turn to the light.
Oh! I want to see those pearls.
Yeah! - [MEOWS] - Who you gonna call? [SCATTING] [LAUGHS] Oh! Adorable, baby.
Just adorable! - God.
You are such a nerd.
- Shut up.
No wonder you only hang out with boys.
- Erica! - Just the facts.
[MOUTHING] Nerd.
[MRS.
SINCLAIR] My God, I love this costume.
Keep it up.
[MIKE] All right, that's the last one.
No, just one more.
Come on, please? Ah! - Can I go to school? - Wait, wait.
- Okay, say, "Who you gonna call?" - No! [ALL SINGING "GHOSTBUSTERS"] - Who you gonna call? - Ghostbusters! Hey, Spengler! - Egon! Yeah! - Venkman! Whoa! Whoa! - What? - Why are you Venkman? - Because I'm Venkman.
- No, I'm Venkman.
Why can't there be two Venkmans? Because there's only one Venkman in real life.
We planned this months ago.
I'm Venkman, Dustin's Stantz, you're Egon, and you're Winston.
- I specifically didn't agree to Winston.
- Yes, you did! - I don't think he did.
- No one wants to be Winston, man.
What's wrong with Winston? What's wrong with Winston? He joined the team super late, he's not funny, and he's not even a scientist! - Yeah, but he's still cool.
- If he's cool, then you be Winston.
- I can't! - Why not? - [STUTTERS] Because - [MOCKING MIKE] Because you're not black? - I didn't say that! - You thought it.
- I didn't say that! - Mike! Guys Guys! Guys! Why is no one else wearing costumes? [SCHOOL BELL RINGING] Crap.
- [STUDENTS LAUGHING] - [STUDENT] Oh, my God! When do people make these decisions? [WILL] Everyone dressed up last year.
- It's a conspiracy, I'm telling you.
- Just be cool.
[BOY] Who you gonna call? The nerds! - We gonna do this? - Not right now.
We look like morons.
[DUSTIN] Maybe she likes Ghostbusters? Of course she likes Ghostbusters, but that's not the point.
The point is we're dressed up and she isn't.
[DUSTIN] I didn't bring regular clothes.
You? [LUCAS] No.
Then we have no choice.
We gotta do this.
It's now or never.
- Right.
[SNIFFS] - Let's engage.
We could ask her after class.
- Yup.
- Okay.
[JOYCE] See? It's an exact match.
- But why would he lie to me? - [INHALES DEEPLY] He's a kid, Joyce.
I mean, you heard him describe these episodes.
It's not like he's describing a nightmare.
He talks about them like they're real.
Yeah, because they're not nightmares, they're flashbacks.
I know a couple guys who have had these things, and it feels like you're there, like it's happening.
- Then what the hell is this? - Owens said it would get worse.
- That place - What do you wanna do? You wanna take him back to Chicago? Well, there's that guy in Boston that's supposed to be They're all a bunch of quacks.
They'll all tell you the same thing, just cost you more money.
I think he's right about trauma.
And we're coming up on a year, you know.
I think everybody's on edge.
Me, you Will most of all.
I think we just gotta get through the next few weeks.
[SIGHS] [SIGHS] Nothing's gonna go back to the way that it was.
Not really.
But it'll get better.
In time.
[SIGHS HEAVILY] [JOYCE MUMBLES] - Here.
- Thank you.
- [CHOKES AND COUGHS] - [CHUCKLES] Jesus! Hopper Brings me back to old times.
What? - [SIGHS] Sharing my cigarettes between - Fifth and sixth period.
Yeah, under the steps.
Mr.
Cooper caught us that time, remember? He was like, [GRUFFLY] "Hey, assholes.
" We ran.
We just ran.
[CHUCKLES] God, I want this to be over.
I know.
[JOYCE SNIFFLES] [BEEPS] [STATIC CRACKLING] How's it looking out there, cowboy? [MAN] Uh, you know, Doc.
The usual.
Nice and nasty with a chance of radioactivity.
Oh, yeah, it's barbecued all right.
Anyone hungry? [TECHNICIAN] And [BEEPING] we're back on! [CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] [WILL] There was this storm.
[OWENS] Okay.
So how did you feel when you saw the storm? [WILL] I felt frozen.
[OWENS] Actually frozen? Cold? [WILL] No, like how you feel when you're scared, and you can't breathe or talk or do anything.
I felt I felt this evil [BARBARA ECHOING] Nancy, this isn't you.
[NANCY] Barb, just go ahead and go home, okay? [BARBARA] Nancy? Nancy! Nancy.
What's going on? Are you okay? - I can't keep doing this.
- Doing what? - Pretending like everything's okay.
- What are you talking about? Barbara.
It's like everyone forgot.
It's like nobody cares.
Except her parents.
- And now they're selling their house.
- Nance And they're going to spend the rest of their lives looking for her.
- I know.
- It's destroying them.
I know.
Okay? I get it.
But listen, there's nothing we can do about it.
Yeah, we could tell them the truth.
Well, you know that we can't do that.
We don't have to tell them everything.
This isn't some game, Nance.
If they found out that we told any They could put us in jail.
Okay? Or worse, they could destroy our families.
They could do anything they want.
Okay? Just think about what you're saying.
Hey Hey, hey Hey, it's [SIGHS] It's hard, but let's let's just go to Tina's stupid party wear our stupid costumes that we've been working on for a stupid amount of time, and just pretend like we're stupid teenagers, okay? Can we just do that, just for tonight? Okay.
Come here.
[NANCY SIGHS] [RINGING] [DUSTIN CLEARS THROAT] Um Hi, Max.
I'm Dustin, and this is - Lucas.
- Yeah, I know.
The stalkers.
[STUTTERS] Uh, no.
Actually We weren't stalking you.
No, we were just concerned because, you know, you're new and all.
Yeah, for your safety.
Mmm-hmm.
There are a lot of bullies here.
- [STUTTERING] So many bullies, it's crazy.
- Yeah.
Is that why you're wearing proton packs? Well, these don't function.
But I do have this handy-dandy little trap here.
And look, it even opens and closes.
Look, look, look VoilÃ ! [CHUCKLES] It's cool, right? No? Okay.
But, um So, we were talking last night, and you're new here, so you probably don't have any friends to take you trick-or-treating, and you're scared of bullies, so we were thinking that it would be okay if you come with us.
- "It'd be okay"? - Yeah.
Our party's a democracy, the majority voted you could come.
Didn't realize it was such an honor to go trick-or-treating with you.
We know where to get the full-sized candy bars.
We figured you'd want in.
That's presumptuous of you.
Yeah.
Totally.
Uh, so, um you'll come? We're meeting at the Maple Street cul-de-sac at 7:00.
That's 7:00 on the dot! "Presumptuous.
" That's a good thing, right? [SIGHS] Is it bad? Lucas, is it bad? Lucas? Son of a bitch, Lucas.
Is it bad? [WOMAN ON TV] How does it feel? Like pouring pure silk onto my skin.
[MAN] Inhuman.
Relentless.
Arnold Schwarzenegger is The Term Well, I'm stunned.
I don't know what to think.
- [MAN] Don't you love me? - [ERICA] Of course I love you.
It's just that it's so sudden.
I mean, it's not like you.
Erica, I am this way because of you.
- [ERICA] Me? - "Me?" [MAN] Mmm-hmm.
You have made me wild and impetuous, - just like you.
- "Impetuous.
" People are going to be aghast.
- "People are going to be aghast.
" - [MAN LAUGHS] They're gonna love it.
[BOTH LAUGHING ON TV] I mean, it's gonna stun the whole town.
The whole world! Erica, tell me that you will marry me, in this house, tonight [TELEVISION CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] [CHITTERING] [CHITTERING] [TWIG SNAPS] Hey.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
What's your name? What're you doing out here in the cold? [GRUNTS] [TIRES SCREECHING] [FLIES BUZZING] So, you're telling me that Merrill poisoned your farm, because he thinks you poisoned his, which, of course, you didn't? No, sir.
And I got me an alibi the night he accuses me.
My Jenny and her boys were in town.
I was with them all night.
- Did you actually see Merrill? - No need.
That man done lost his mind.
Went around slandering me, threatening all sorts of madness.
- A pumpkin conspiracy.
- [CHUCKLES] Hawkins' very own Chinatown.
Merrill threatening to do something and him actually doing something are two very different things.
- You got a better explanation? - Cold weather.
- It's October.
- Yeah, it's a cold one.
- You see these hands? - Yeah.
- You know why they look like that? - Because you're old? - You're damn straight.
- [POWELL CHUCKLES] And I've been doing this a long time, Chief.
A long time.
And I ain't never seen anything the likes of this.
- None of us have.
- None of us? Merrill didn't just hit me last night.
He hit damn near everyone.
What are you talking about? Jack O'Dell, Pete Freeling, Rick Neary, the Christensens.
All of their crops, dead.
Give me those names again.
You're late again.
- Yeah, I had to get catch-up homework.
- Jesus.
I don't care.
You're late again, and you're skating home.
Do you hear me? ["WANGO TANGO" BY TED NUGENT PLAYING] - [SONG CONTINUES ON CAR RADIO] - God, this place is such a shithole.
- It's not that bad.
- No? [BILLY INHALES DEEPLY] Mmm! You smell that, Max? That's actually shit.
- Cow shit.
- I don't see any cows.
Clearly, you haven't met the high-school girls.
- [SCOFFS] So what, you like it here now? - No.
- Then why are you defending it? - I'm not.
Sure sounds like it.
- It's just we're stuck here, so - Hmm.
You're right.
We're stuck here.
And whose fault is that? Yours.
- What'd you say? - Nothing.
- Did you say it's my fault? - No.
You know whose fault it is.
Say it.
Max say it.
Say it! ["WANGO TANGO" CONTINUES PLAYING] Really, everyone dressed up last year.
Billy, slow down.
- Oh, these your new hick friends? - No! I don't know them.
I guess you won't care if I hit 'em, then? I get bonus points, I get 'em all in one go? No, Billy, stop.
It's not funny.
[REVVING] Hey, guys? Billy, come on, stop it.
It's not funny.
Stop! - Go! - Mike, you need to haul ass! - Billy, stop it! - [TIRES SCREECHES] [DUSTIN] Whoa! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Yeah! That was a close one, huh? [BILLY LAUGHS] [DUSTIN] Holy shit! Was that Mad Max.
["WANGO TANGO" CONTINUES PLAYING] [WIND CHIMES RATTLING] [FLIES BUZZING] Now, you tryin' to tell me, with a straight face, cold did this? How far does it go? [POWELL OVER RADIO] Hey, Chief, you copy? [HOPPER] Uh Hey, Chief.
[HOPPER] How's it looking over there? Like a giant pissed all over Jack's bean field.
Smells, too.
It smell over there? Uh, yeah, little bit.
[GRUNTS] Smells like a nursing home, man.
Listen.
I want you guys to track the rot, see how far it goes.
Just, uh, mark anything that's dead.
- That's gonna take some time.
- So take it.
And, look, we don't know what caused this.
Could be poison.
So don't touch anything without gloves.
[SNIFFS] Copy that, Chief.
[SIGHS] You got any marking flags? So you hit "T" to zoom in, and "W" zooms back out.
See? Easy-peasy.
Just make sure to turn off the power to save energy there.
Listen.
Stay close to your brother, okay? And listen, listen, listen If you get a bad feeling or anything, you tell him to take you straight home.
- You promise? - Okay.
- Are you ready, bud? - Yeah.
Be safe.
[IMITATING DRACULA] I hope it doesn't suck! - [SNICKERS] - [CHUCKLES] [JONATHAN] I just don't get what she sees in him.
What? Bob.
At least he doesn't treat me different.
I mean, I can't even go trick-or-treating by myself.
It's lame.
What? You think I'm lame? No, but it's not like Nancy's coming to watch over Mike, you know? [SIGHS] [DUSTIN] Will! Hey! [CAR HORN HONKS] [DUSTIN] Hey, don't cross the streams.
Don't cross the streams! [SIGHS] Hey, listen.
Yeah? If I let you go on your own, you promise to stay in the neighborhood? - Yeah! Yeah, yeah, totally.
- And be back at Mike's by 9:00.
- 9:30? - 9:00.
- Yeah.
- Deal? - Yeah, deal.
- All right.
Hey, Will.
Don't let any of your spazzy friends use this, all right? Okay.
[IMITATING DRACULA] I hope it doesn't suck.
[WILL CHUCKLES] [LUCAS] Will! - Egon! - Yeah! You ready for tonight, man? Awesome! ["SHOUT AT THE DEVIL" BY MÃTLEY CRÃE PLAYING] [ALL] thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty, forty-one, forty-two! [ALL CHEERING LOUDLY] - Yeah! - Forty-two! We got ourselves a new Keg King! - [CHANTING] Billy! Billy! Billy! - That's how you do it, Hawkins! Billy! Billy! Billy!

[SIGHS] I know.
It's just every time he's away from me, it's like I can't function.
- I know it sounds silly.
- No, it's not silly.
It's not silly.
What if we were to move out of Hawkins together? - What? - I know.
Whoa, Nellie, right? No, I just I've been thinking about what you said.
About how we've got all these memories here, and you wish you had enough money to move.
Well, my parents are selling their house in Maine.
There's a RadioShack nearby.
I'm sure they'd take me on.
We could just - My turn to be silly now.
- [SIGHS] Bob No, it's fine.
Wine makes me crazy.
Oh, it's just so hard to explain.
It's just this This is not a normal family.
It could be.

Everything is nothing If you got no one And you just walk in the night Slowly losing sight of the real thing [DOORBELL RINGS] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Finally.
