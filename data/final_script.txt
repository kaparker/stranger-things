A shadow grows on the wall behind you, swallowing you in darkness.

Turning now to local news, we're getting reports of surges and power outages all across the county.
Last night, hundreds of homes in East Hawkins were affected, leaving many residents in the dark.
The cause of the outage is still unknown.
We reached out to Roane County Water and Electric, and a spokesperson says that they are confident power will be restored to all remaining homes within the next several hours.
Mmm.

I'm just saying, does that seem smart to you? Shut up.
Shut up.

----------
1 Is there a number we can call for your parents? Where's your hair? Do you have cancer? Did you run away? - Are you in some kind of trouble? - Is that blood? - Stop it! You're freaking her out! - She's freaking me out! I bet she's deaf.

Oh, so you can speak.
Okay, well Um, how about we just keep the door just like this.
- Is that better? - Yes.
- This is mental.
- At least she can talk.
She said "no" and "yes.
" Your three-year-old sister says more.
She tried to get naked.
There's something seriously wrong with her.
- Like, wrong in the head.
- She just went like I bet she escaped from Pennhurst.
- From where? - The nuthouse in Kerley County.
- You got a lot of family there? - Bite me.
Seriously though, think about it.
That would explain her shaved hair and why she's so crazy.
Why she went like She's an escapee is the point.
She's probably a psycho.
- Like Michael Myers.
- Exactly! We should've never brought her here.
So you just wanted to leave her out in that storm? Yes! We went out to find Will, not another problem.
- I think we should tell your mom.
- I second that.
- Who's crazy now? - How is that crazy? 'Cause, we weren't supposed to be out tonight, remember? - So? - So if I tell my mom and she tells your mom and your mom - Oh, man.
- Our houses become Alcatraz.
Exactly.
We'll never find Will.
All right, here's the plan.
She sleeps here tonight.
- You're letting a girl - Just listen! In the morning, she sneaks around my house, goes to the front door and rings my doorbell.
My mom will answer and know exactly what to do.
She'll send her back to Pennhurst or wherever she comes from.
We'll be totally in the clear.
And tomorrow night, we go back out.
And this time, we find Will.
Here you go.
This is my sleeping bag.
You really think she's psycho? Wouldn't want her in my house.
Mental.
Hey, um, I never asked your name.
Is that real? Sorry, I've just never seen a kid with a tattoo before.
What's it mean? Eleven? That's your name? Eleven.
Okay.
Um, well, my name's Mike.
Short for Michael.
Maybe we can call you "El.
" Short for Eleven.
Um, well, okay.
'Night, El.
'Night, Mike.
All right, Mom.
Breakfast is ready.
- What? No, be careful of the poster.
- Yeah, okay.

- And? - Nothing.
God.
Flo says you got a phone call? Oh, yeah.
Storm barbecued this pretty good.
- The storm? - What else? You're saying that that's not weird? No, it's weird.
Can we, like, trace who made the call? Contact the No, it doesn't work like that.
Now, uh, you're sure it was Will? Because Flo said you just heard some breathing.
No.
It was him.
It was Will.
And he was scared.
And then something It was probably just a prank call.
It was somebody trying to scare you.
- Who would do that? - Well, this thing's been on TV.
It brings out all the crazies, you know.
False leads, prank calls, uh No, Hopper, it was not a prank.
It was him.
- Joyce.
- Come on, how about a little trust here? What, you think I'm I'm making this up? I'm not saying that you're making it up.
All I'm saying is it's an emotional time for you.
And you think I don't know my own son's breathing? Wouldn't you know your own daughter's? - You hear from, uh, Lonnie yet? - No.
It's been long enough.
I'm having him checked out.
Oh, come on! You're wasting your time.
Hey, Hopper.
Hopper.
Let me go.
- I'm sorry? - To Lonnie's.
You know, if Will's there, it means he ran away.
And if he sees the cops, he'll think he's in trouble.
He'll He'll hide.

Mostly Lucas, 'cause he lives so close.
Signal's pretty weak.
Got you breakfast.
So listen, this is gonna sound a little weird, but I just need you to go out there.
Then go to the front door and ring the doorbell.
My mom will answer and you'll tell her that you're lost and that you need help.
But whatever you do, you can't tell her about last night or that you know me.
Understand? Really, it's no big deal.
We'll just pretend to meet each other again.
And my mom, she'll know who to call.
No.
No? No.
No you don't want my mom to get help? You're in trouble, aren't you? Who Who are you in trouble with? Bad.

When was this? Last night.
Less than two miles away.
- And the boy? - Still missing.
It was my son.

Oh, if Mrs.
Wheeler tells my parents - No way.

We got first every year.
Except for last year when we got third.
Mr.
Clarke said it was totally political.

- Michael? Please? Pop! Papa! Papa! No! Papa! No! No! No! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa.
I just I don't feel good.
I woke up and my head, it really hurt bad, and my throat was all scratchy, and I wanted to tell you, but the last time I told you I was sick - you made me go to school anyway, and - Michael.
- Yeah? - I'm not mad at you.
- No? - No, of course not.
All this that's been going on with Will, I can't imagine what it's been like for you.
I just I want you to feel like you can talk to me.
I never want you to feel like you have to hide anything from me.
I'm here for you.
Okay? Is there someone else here? No.
Eleven? Is everything okay? El? - Mike.
- Is everything okay? Are you sure? Promise.
- Will Byers! - Will! Whoa, whoa.
Careful, careful.
I need you alive for the next few days, at least.
Oh, hell, I could survive that.
What? George Burness made the jump.
And he was drunk as a skunk.
He did it on a $10 bet.
George is a liar.
You make that jump from this height, that water turns into cement.
Hits you like a ton of bricks.
Break every damn bone in your body.
Nah.
Chief, you copy? Yeah, Flo, talk to me.
Hey, Chief, we got a call from over at Benny's.
I think you need to get there right away.
Ugh, Jesus! Suicide? Mmm-hmm.
Missing kid, suicide You must feel like a big city cop again, huh, Chief? Well, I mostly dealt with strangers back then.
Benny was my friend.
Hello? Yeah.
- Can I help you? - Yeah, is Lonnie around? - Yeah, he's out back.
What do you want? - To look around.
- Hey, what do you think you're doing? Hey! - I'll be fast.
Hey, Will? Will! Will, you here? Will! Get off! Damn, you've gotten stronger.
Will someone please explain what the hell is going on? Jonathan, Cynthia.
Cynthia, this is Jonathan.
My oldest.
- Come here.
- Get off me, man.
- Are you out of your mind? - Just listen to me.
- You are out of your mind! - She knows about Will.
What do you mean she knows about Will? She pointed at him, at his picture.
She knew he was missing.
I could tell.
- You could tell? - Just think about it.
Do you really think it was a coincidence that we found her on Mirkwood, the same place where Will disappeared? - That is weird.
- And she said bad people are after her.
I think maybe these bad people are the same ones that took Will.
- I think she knows what happened to him.
- Then why doesn't she tell us? Do you know where he is? Do you know where Will is? - Stop it, you're scaring her! - She should be scared! If you know where he is, tell us! This is nuts.
We have to take her to your mom.
No! Eleven said telling any adult would put us in danger.
- What kind of danger? - Her name is Eleven? - El for short.
- Mike, what kind of danger? Danger danger.
No, no, no! We're going back to plan A.
We're telling your mom.
No.
Take a look at this beaut.
Should've seen it when I got it.
Took me a year, but it's almost done.
Really? You want to check up my ass, too? I told you the same thing as I told those cops, he's not here and he never has been.
- Then why didn't you call Mom back? - I don't know, I just I assumed she just forgot where he was.
You know, he was lost or something.
That boy never was very good at taking care of himself.
This isn't some joke, all right? There are search parties, reporters Hopper's not still chief, is he? Tell your mother she's gotta get you out of that hellhole.
Come out here to the city.
People are more real here, you know? And then I could see you more.
- What, you think I don't want to see you? - I know you don't.
See, that's your mother talkin' right there.
She even know you're here? Oh, great.
So one kid goes missing, the other one runs wild? Some real fine parenting right there.
Look, all I'm saying is, maybe I'm not the asshole, all right? In case you forgot what he looks like.
He's kinda cute, hmm? Maybe I'll trade you in for the younger model? Just doesn't make any sense, Chief.
You, uh, notice anything odd about him the last few weeks? No, we're fixin' to go fishing down the Etowah next Sunday.
I mean, he was lookin' forward to it.
I know that.
He got any enemies you might know about? I mean, people who might not want him around? The exes didn't like him much.
That's for sure, but nah.
- When was the last time you saw him? - Yesterday.
Lunch, same as always.
- Just you and the boys? - Yep.
Me and Henry and Well, there was this, uh, this kid.
No kid did this.
Kid? What are you talking about? Yeah.
At lunch, uh, there was this boy that, uh I mean, he was trying to steal food out of Benny's kitchen.
Can you imagine that? This kid what'd he look like? Well, he was about yea high.
You know, tiny like.
I didn't get a good look at him, though.
He was back in the kitchen.
He look like this? Oh, no, that's That's Lonnie's missin' kid.
No.
This was a different kid.
This one had really short hair.
I mean, it was buzzed nearly down to the scalp.
Yeah, well, let's You know, let's forget about the haircut.
I mean, if this kid had a buzz cut could it be Lonnie's kid? Well, I I didn't get a good look at him.
About the right height, though.
I mean, could've been.
Yeah, that's Could've been.
Because I don't want to go by myself.
Barb Barb, it's not rocket science.
You just tell your parents you're gonna stay at my place afterwards.
No, tell them we're studying.
Nancy! Dinner! Coming! Look, I gotta go.
I'll see you in an hour.
Something wrong with the meatloaf? Oh, no, I had two bologna sandwiches for lunch.
I don't know why.
Me, too.
- It's delicious, Mommy.
- Thank you, sweetie.
So, there's this special assembly thing tonight for Will at the school field.
Barb's driving.
Why am I just hearing about this? I thought you knew.
I told you, I don't want you out after dark until Will is found.
I know, I know, but it'd be super weird if I'm not there.
I mean, everyone's going.
Just be back by 10:00.
Why don't you take the boys, too? - No! - Mmm-mmm.
Don't you think you should be there? For Will? Sorry.
Spasm.
Oh It's okay, Holly.
- It's just a loud noise.
- Nice.
Will! Better come out, buddy.
Will, where are ya? Hey, you think Earl really saw Will? I mean, what's he doin' with a shaved head? And stealing food from Benny? Tell you what, when we find him, we'll ask.
Can't ask a corpse questions.
Hold up! You got something? - Hey, what do you got? - Not sure.
Maybe nothing.
I found this.
In there.
No way a kid crawls through there.
I don't know a scared enough one might.
His brother said he was good at hiding.
El? No adults.
Just us and some meatloaf.
Don't worry.
They won't tell anyone about you.
They promise.
Right? We never would've upset you if we knew you had superpowers.
Ow! What Dustin is trying to say is that they were just scared earlier.
That's all.
We just wanted to find our friend.
"Friend"? Yeah, friend.
Will? What is "friend"? Is she serious? Um, a friend Is someone that you'd do anything for.
You lend them your cool stuff, like comic books and trading cards.
And they never break a promise.
- Especially when there's spit.
- Spit? - A spit swear means - you never break your word.
It's a bond.
That's super important, because friends they tell each other things.
Things that parents don't know.
- Barbara, pull over.
- What? Pull over! What are we doing here? His house is three blocks away.
We can't park in the driveway.
Are you serious? Yeah, the neighbors might see.
This is so stupid.
I'm just gonna drop you off.

No, he doesn't.
Nance seriously.
He invited you to his house.
His parents aren't home.
Come on, you are not this stupid.
Tommy H.

Tommy and Carol have been having sex since, like, seventh grade.
It'll probably just be, like, a big orgy.
- Gross.
- I'm serious! All right, well you can be, like, my guardian.
All right? Make sure I don't get drunk and do anything stupid.
Ugh.
Is that a new bra? No.

Army knife also from 'Nam.
Hammer, camouflage bandana and the wrist rocket.
You're gonna take out the Demogorgon with a slingshot? First of all, it's a wrist rocket.
And second of all, the Demogorgon's not real.
It's made up.
But if there is something out there, I'm gonna shoot it in the eye - and blind it.
- Dustin, what did you get? Well, alrighty.
So, we've got Nutty Bars, Bazooka, Pez, Smarties, Pringles, Nilla Wafers, apple, - banana, and trail mix.

Space weapons? Yeah.
You know, like, Reagan's Star Wars.
I guess we're gonna blow the Ruskies to smithereens.
Hey, can I help you? Uh, yeah.
We're here for a tour.
Oh, we don't give tours.
Okay A quick look around.
You have to get clearance for that.
You can contact, uh Rick Schaeffer at the Department of Energy.
Maybe you seen it on TV.
We got a local kid that's missing.
We have reason to believe he might have snuck in here.
Like I said, you have to speak to Mr.
Schaeffer.
- What's your name? - Patrick.
Patrick, I got a panicked mayor, and I got reporters breathing down my neck and I got a very upset mother.
Now, I know the kid's not in there, but I gotta check off this box.
Patrick, would you do me a favor? Would you speak to your boss and see what you can swing for us? I'd really appreciate it.
I'm talking ten minutes, tops.
was occupying a large part of Lebanon.
Today, Syria has become a home for I have the power! gift that will last forever.
From the Harmony Treasures' collection On the beach and in the sun The real thing is so much fun All the times of your life And the things that you do Coke is right there with you Coke is it! Coke is it! - Joyce - Just ring me up, Donald.
And you think this missing boy may have crawled through there? Well, that was the idea.
Yeah, I just don't see how that'd be possible.
We've got over 100 cameras.
Every square inch covered, plus all my guys.
No one breaks in here.
Certainly not some kid.
Those cameras, you keep the tapes? If you don't mind me asking, what do you guys do in here? You're asking the wrong guy.
- Staying one step ahead of the Russians? - I expect.
Something like that.
- Who's in charge here? - That'd be Dr.
Brenner.
And he builds the space lasers? - Space lasers? - Ignore him.
This is the night of the 6th and 7th we're seeing here? That's correct.
Is that it? Like I said, we would have seen him.
The night of the 7th, we had a search party out for Will.
You remember anything about that night? Mmm, not much to remember.
Called it off.
- 'Cause of the storm.
- Yeah, a lot of rain that night.
You see any rain on that tape? What are you thinking? I don't know.
But they're lying.
That's why science doesn't make any damn sense to me.
No, I swear.
Look at this.
It's totally frostbite.
Oh, thanks, man.
It's a heated pool.
Well, if it's not frostbite, then what is it? Ugh, I don't care what it is, it's disgusting! Get it off the table.
We're eating here.
Ew! Hey, Tommy.
When you left, did you see Barb? - What? - Barbara.
She's not here today.
I seriously have no idea who you're talking about.
Come on, don't be an ass, man.
Did you Did you see her leave last night or not? No, she was gone when we left.
Probably couldn't stand listening to all that moaning.
Oh, Steve! - Oh, Steve! Oh, Steve! - Oh, Steve Oh, Steve! Okay, chill.
Listen I'm sure she's fine.
She's probably just she's probably just, like, skipping or something.
Yeah.
Yeah, probably.
- How about this one? - Too big for the sling.
So, do you think Eleven was born with her powers, like the X-Men, or do you think she acquired them, like like Green Lantern? She's not a superhero.
She's a weirdo.
Why does that matter? The X-Men are weirdos.
If you love her so much, why don't you marry her? What are you talking about? - Mike, seriously? - What? You look at her all, like "Hi, El! El! El! El! I love you so much! - Would you marry me?" - Shut up, Lucas.
Yeah, shut up, Lucas.
What are you losers doing back here? Probably looking for their missing friend.
That's not funny.
It's serious.
He's in danger.
I hate to break it to you, Toothless, but he's not in danger.
He's dead.
That's what my dad says.
He said he was probably killed by some other queer.
Come on.
Just ignore them.
Watch where you're going, Frogface.
- You all right? - Yeah.
Hey.
How about this one? - Yeah.
- Yeah? Yeah, this is it.
Oh, yeah.

Sorry I wasted your time.
I'm a dick.
" Yep.
I'm sorry.
Uh Maybe we could go out again next week? Newspapers? You guys got newspapers around here? We have the New York Times, the Post, all the big ones.

But she did come home, right? After the vigil? No, she said she was staying with you last night.
Right, yes.
She did, sorry.
I meant, did she come home this morning? I think she left some textbooks and she was gonna go pick them up.
Oh, um, no, I haven't seen her.
Do Do you know what? I just remembered she's at the library.
Nancy, will you please have her call me as soon as you find her? Yeah.

Sorry to bother you.

- I was looking for my brother.
- No.
No, this is called stalking.
Mmm-hmm.
- What's going on? - Here's the starring lady.
What? This creep was spying on us last night.
He was probably gonna save this one for later.
See, you can tell that he knows it was wrong, but Man, that's the thing about perverts It's hardwired into 'em.
You know, they just can't help themselves.
So we'll just have to take away his toy.
- Steve - No, please, not the camera.
No, no, wait, wait Tommy, Tommy.
It's okay.

Saturday.
I bet Mr.
Mundy's still a virgin.
Oh, he's so a virgin! Maybe you should blow him, Carol.
Help your grades a bit.
Whoa, Nance, where you going? I totally forgot.
I told my mom I would, um I would do something with her.
Well, what do you mean? The game's about to start.
I'm sorry.
What the hell's wrong with her? Maybe she freaked out when you went all psycho on the psycho.
Oh, give me a break.
What'd you expect, dating Miss Perfect? Why did they hurt you? What? Oh, that.
Uh I just fell at recess.
- Mike - Yeah? Friends tell the truth.
I was tripped by this mouth breather, Troy, okay? Mouth breather? Yeah, you know a dumb person.
A knucklehead.
Knucklehead? I don't know why I just didn't tell you.
Everyone at school knows.
I just didn't want you to think I was such a wastoid, you know? - Mike - Yeah? I understand.
Oh.
Okay, cool.

I need to find you.
Tell me what to do.
Please just Will Hey! You're home early! How was the game? Nancy? What's the matter? It's Barb.
I think something happened.
Something terrible.
I don't know, Chief.
What don't you know? This lady, Terry Ives, sounds like a real nut to me.
Her kid was taken for LSD mind control experiments? She's been discredited.
Claim was thrown out Okay, forget about her.
Take a look at this.
- Dr.
Martin Brenner.
- Who? Brenner.
He runs Hawkins Lab.
Okay.
You don't find that interesting? Not really.
He was involved in some hippie crap back in the day, so what? No, this isn't hippie crap.
This is CIA-sanctioned research.
Doesn't mean he had anything to do with our kid.
Come on.
Look at that.
Hospital gowns.
All of 'em.
Now, that piece of fabric that the teacher found by the pipe.
That sure looked like a hospital gown to me, huh? - Am I wrong? - I don't know, Chief.
Come on, man.
Work with me here.
I'm not saying that there's some grand conspiracy.
I'm just I'm saying maybe something happened.
Maybe Will was in the wrong place at the wrong time and he saw something that he shouldn't have.
- It's a reach.
- It's a start.
Hey, Powell, is the chief with you? Hopper here.
What do you got? Here.
Yeah, this is where Will lives.
Hiding.
No, no, this is where he lives.
He's missing from here.
Understand? - What are we doing here? - She said he's hiding here.
Um no! I swear, if we walked all the way out here for nothing That's exactly what we did.
I told you she didn't know what the hell she was talking about! Why did you bring us here? - Mike, don't waste your time with her.
- What do you want to do then? Call the cops, like we should have done yesterday.
- We are not calling the cops! - Hey, guys? - What other choice do we have? - Guys! Will Okay.
Okay, baby, talk to me.
Talk to me.
Where are you? "R.
" Good, good, good, good.
That's good.
Come on, come on.
"I G H T H E R E" "Right here.

I need you to tell me what to do.
What should I do? How do I get to you? How do I find you? What should I do? Oh, Jesus.
Oh, God.
Please tell me it's not the kid.
It's not Will.
It can't be.
It's Will.
It's really Will.
Mike "Mike"? "Mike," what? You were supposed to help us find him alive.
You said he was alive! Why did you lie to us? What's wrong with you? What is wrong with you? - Mike - What? Mike, come on.
Don't do this, man.
Mike Mike, where are you going? Mike! Mike! Mom? Mom, what happened? It's okay.
Hey.
Michael? What's wrong? Support us and become VIP member 
----------
1 This the wall she was talking about, Chief? A trooper found something in the, uh water that's at the quarry.
Our working theory right now is that Will crashed his bike, he made his way over the quarry and, uh accidentally fell in.
The earth must have given way.
Joyce? Joyce? Do you understand what I'm saying? No.
Whoever you found is not my boy.
- It's not Will.
- Joyce.
No, you don't understand.
I talked to him a half hour ago.
He was He was here.
He was He was talking with these.
- Talking? - Uh-huh.
One blink for yes, two for no.
And And, uh And then I made this so he could talk to me.
'Cause he was hiding from that that thing.
The thing that came out of the wall? - The thing that chased you? - Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Mom, come on, please.
- You've gotta stop this.
- No, maybe he's It's after him! - He's in danger.
We have to find him! We - What exactly was this thing? It was some kind of animal, you said? Uh, no, it was It was almost human, but it wasn't.
It It had these long arms and it didn't have a face.
It didn't have a face? - Joyce.
- It didn't have a face Joyce, listen to me.
Listen to me.
After Sarah I saw her, too.
And I heard her.
I didn't know what was real.
And then I figured out that it was in my mind.
And I had to pack all that away.
Otherwise, I was gonna fall down a hole that I couldn't get out of.
No, you're you're talking about grief.
This is different.
- I'm just saying that you - No, I know what you're saying, Hop.
I swear to you, I know what I saw.
And I'm not crazy.
I'm not saying that you're crazy.
No You are.
And I understand, but God, I I need you to believe me.
Please.
Please.
Listen I think you should go to the morgue tomorrow and see him for yourself.
It'll give you the answers that you need.
- But tonight - Oh, God.
I want you to try to get some sleep, if you can.
Byers' body was found in the water of this quarry by state police earlier this evening.
It was discovered by state trooper David O'Bannon, just after dark.
The state police are mounting an investigation to determine Byers' cause of death, but an initial inquiry Should I go down and talk to Michael? Give him time.
He'll come to us when he's ready.
Can you please stop that? Are you deaf? I thought we were friends, you know? But friends tell each other the truth.
And they definitely don't lie to each other.
You made me think Will was okay, that he was still out there, but he wasn't.
He wasn't! Maybe you thought you were helping, but you weren't.
You hurt me.
Do you understand? What you did sucks.
Lucas was right about you.
All along.
So come on and let me know Should I stay or should I go? Should I stay or should I go now? Should I stay or should I go now? If I go there will be trouble If I stay it will be double Will, is that you? It's Mike! Do you copy? Over.

What what time is it? It's almost 8:00.
We have to go.
Go where? Where? To see Will.
Michael? Hi, honey.
How are you feeling? I, uh I don't think I can go to school today.
Oh, that's fine, sweetie.
I need to drop off Nance, then I'm gonna check in on Barb's parents.
Why don't you grab a book or something and come with me? We can stop by the video store on the way back, pick out whatever you want.
Even R-rated.
I think I just want to stay home today.
I mean, if that's okay? Well, are you sure you're gonna be all right here by yourself? I think so.
Okay.
But if you need anything, call Dad at work.
- Okay.
- Okay.

No, not his funeral.
- Screw his funeral! - What? Just get over here stat.
And bring Dustin.
Over and out.
What's taking so long? Well, everything's been a bit chaotic around here without Gary.
Without Gary? - Where's Gary? - Well, I thought you knew.
Those men from State, they they sent Gary home last night.
So who did the autopsy? Someone from State.
He has a birth mark on his right arm.
Can you show that to me, please? How's your mom doing? I don't know.
How long's this stuff been going on? With the lights and, uh Will and the thing in the wall? Since the first phone call, I guess.
You know, she's had anxiety problems in the past.
But this I don't know.
I'm worried it could be Ugh, I don't know.
She'll be okay.
We'll be okay.
My mom she's tough.
Yeah, she is.
Hey.
She is.
Ma'am! - Ma'am, I need you to sign! - I don't I don't know what you think that thing is in there, but that is not my son! - Joyce, wait a second.
- No! - Mom! - Ma'am, I Ma'am! So, wait a sec.
I don't understand.
You went back to my house? To look for Barb.
Yeah, okay, but why didn't you just talk to me? That's crazy.
I don't know, I I was scared.
You seriously think you saw a guy in a mask just hanging out in my yard? I don't think it was a mask.
But he had no face? I don't know! I don't know, I just I have a terrible feeling about this.
Oh, this is bad.
This is really bad.
What? The cops they're gonna want to talk to all of us now.
Tommy, Carol, everybody who was at the party.
- So? - My parents are gonna murder me! Are you serious right now? You don't understand.
My dad's a grade-A asshole.
Barb is missing! And you're worried about your dad? Okay, just When you talk to the cops, just don't mention the beers.
It's just gonna get us both in trouble, and Barbara's got nothing to do with it, okay? I can't believe you right now.
- I can't believe you.
- Nancy.
Nancy, wait! Nancy! - Mom, will you get in? - No, I I need to think.
Just go on home.
Mom, will you just get in, please? Mom.
Mom! Mom.
- Stop.
- Just go home, Jonathan.
No, this is not an okay time for you to shut down.
- Shut down? What - We have to deal with this, Mom.
We have to deal with the funeral! The funeral? - For for who? - For that thing back there? Okay, let me get this straight.
Will, that's not his body, because he's in the lights, right? And there's a monster in the wall? Do you even hear yourself? I know it sounds crazy.
I sound crazy! - Yeah.
- You think I don't know that? It is crazy! But I heard him, Jonathan.
He talked to me! Will is is calling to me! And he's out there, and he's alone, and he's scared, and I I don't care if anyone believes me! I am not gonna stop looking for him until I find him and bring him home.
I am going to bring him home! Yeah, well, while you're talking to the lights, the rest of us are having a funeral for Will! I'm not letting him sit in that freezer another day! All right, show's over.
What? We keep losing the signal, but you heard it, right? Yeah, I heard a baby.
What? Mike, you obviously tapped into a baby monitor.
It's probably the Blackburns' next door.
Uh, did that sound like a baby to you? - That was Will! - Mike Lucas, you don't understand.
He spoke last night.
Words! He was singing that weird song he loves.
Even El heard him! Oh, well, if the weirdo heard him, then I guess Are you sure you're on the right channel? I don't think it's about that.
I think, somehow, she's channeling him.
- Like like Professor X.
- Yeah.
Are you actually believing this crap? I don't know, I mean Do you remember when Will fell off his bike and broke his finger? He sounded a lot like that.
Did you guys not see what I saw? They pulled Will's body out of the water.
He's dead! Well, maybe it's his ghost.
Maybe he's haunting us.
- It's not his ghost.
- So how do you know that? - I just do! - Then what was in that water? I don't know! All I know is Will is alive.
Will is alive! He's out there somewhere.
All we have to do is find him.
This isn't gonna work.
We need to get El to a stronger radio.
- Mr.
Clarke's Heathkit ham shack.
- Yeah.
The Heathkit's at school.
There is no way we're gonna get the weirdo in there without anyone noticing.
I mean look at her.
Wow.
- She looks - Pretty.
Good.
You look pretty good.
Pretty.
Good.
Clear.
- You boys hear me all right in there? - Loud and clear, Shepard.
Good luck in there, son.
"The brown current ran swiftly out of the heart of darkness, bearing us down towards the sea with twice the speed of our upward progress.
And Kurtz's life was running swiftly, too" Nancy Wheeler? If you'll come with me, please? This argument you and Barbara had? What exactly was it about? It wasn't really an argument.
Barb just wanted to leave.
I didn't, so, I I told her to just go home.
Then what? Then I went upstairs to put on some dry clothes.
And the next day, you went back and saw a bear, you're thinking? I don't know what it was, but I think I think maybe it took Barb.
- You need to check behind Steve's house - We did.
There's nothing there.
- There's no sign of a bear.
- And no car.
- What? - Look.
We figure that Barbara came back last night and then she took off, went somewhere else.
Has she ever talked to you about running off? Leaving town, maybe? No.
No, Barb wouldn't do that, ever.
She wasn't maybe upset about the fact that you were spending time with this boy? Uh, Steve Harrington? What? No! Maybe she was jealous because she saw you go up to Steve's room? It wasn't like that.
Like what? Steve and me, we're we're just friends.
We we just talked.
Now was this before or after you changed out of your clothes? So, Gary, tell me about these troopers that brought in Will.
It was about six of 'em, I'd say.
They're all Staties? Yes, sir.
Never seen that many troopers come with a body before.
They told you that they were gonna take care of the autopsy, huh? Yeah.
Claimed jurisdiction.
Kicked me out.
Well, it all seemed a bit over the top to me, considering Considering what? Considering this was Will Byers and not John F.
Kennedy.
- Thanks for stopping by, Gary.
- Sure thing.
let the people know that, uh, the troopers are on duty and you should be safe, because we think this is just an isolated incident.
State trooper David O'Bannon, thank you so much for your help.
- Thank you, sir.
- Back to you Okay, remember, if anyone sees us, look sad.
Attention students, there will be an assembly to honor Will Byers in the gymnasium now.
Do not go to fourth period.
It's locked.
- What? - Hey, do you think you can open it? With your powers? Boys? Hey.
Assembly's about to start.
We know.
We're just, you know Upset.
Yeah, definitely upset.
We need some alone time.
- To cry.
- Yeah, listen I get it.
I do.
I know how hard this is, but let's just be there for Will, huh? And then the Heathkit is all yours for the rest of the day.
What do you say? I don't believe we've met.
What's your name? - Eleven - Eleanor! She's my, uh - Cousin.
- Second cousin.
She's here for Will's funeral.
Ah, well, welcome to Hawkins Middle, Eleanor.
I wish you were here under better circumstances.
Thank you.
Uh, where are you from exactly? Bad place - Sweden! - I have a lot of Swedish family.
- She hates it there.
- Cold! Subzero.
- Shall we? - Yep! At times like these it is important that we come together as a community.
We come Abort.
We come together to heal we come together to grieve - You lied to the police! - I didn't lie! How naive do you think I am? You and Steve were just talking? We slept together! Is that what you want to know? It doesn't matter! - It does matter! - No! It is all bullshit! It has nothing to do with Barb and she's missing.
And something terrible happened to her.
I know it.
I know it! And no one is listening to me! Sweetie, sweetie, I'm listening.
- I'm listening to you - No! You're not! Nancy Nancy! Just leave me alone! Try him again.
Shepard, come in.
Confirm comm.
Shepard, come in.

Shepard, come in! Over.
Will Byers' death is an unimaginable tragedy.
Will was an exceptional student and a wonderful friend to all of us.
It's impossible to express the hole his loss will leave in our community.
I'd like to introduce you to Sandy Sloane.
She's a local grief counselor from the church over in Jonesboro.
But before she comes up here, I just want those of you who are having trouble dealing with this tragic loss Look at these fakers.
They probably didn't even know his name till today.
What? Who is interested in this? This is so stupid.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah Oh, he was such a great student.
Oh, he's going to leave a hole in the community.
Mouth breather.
Hey! Hey! Hey, Troy! Hey, Troy! You you think this is funny? What'd you say, Wheeler? I saw you guys laughing over there.
And I think that's a real messed up thing to do.
Didn't you listen to the counselor, Wheeler? Grief shows itself in funny ways.
Besides, what's there to be sad about, anyway? Will's in fairyland now, right? Flying around with all the other little fairies.
All happy and gay! You're dead, Wheeler! Dead! Dude, Troy peed himself.
Holy shit! Hey! What's going on here? Oh.
Mike! Let's go! It's made of soft wood with a crepe interior.
Uh, now, I I don't know what your budget is, but over here, we we have copper and bronze.
Can you just give me a second? Of course.
Hey.
Hey.
Your mom, um she said you'd be here.
I just Can we talk for a second? It looks like it could be some kind of perspective distortion, but I wasn't using the wide angle.
I don't know.
It's weird.
And you're sure you didn't see anyone else out there? No.
And she was there one second and then, um gone.
I figured she bolted.
The cops think that she ran away.
But they don't know Barb.
And I went back to Steve's and I thought I saw something.
Some weird man or I don't know what it was.
I'm sorry.
I I shouldn't have come here today.
I'm I'm so sorry.
What'd he look like? What? This man you saw in the woods.
What'd he look like? I don't know.
It was almost like he he didn't have Didn't have a face? How did you know that? Aw, come on! Another, please.
And another for my, uh, friend here.
Oh, thanks, man.
Appreciate it.
Yeah, that's all right.
I'm, uh I'm celebrating.
My daughter, she won the spelling bee today.
Is that right? Yeah, that's right.
"Odontalgia.
" That was the word.
You know what it means? It's a fancy name for a toothache.
Yeah, she's smart.
She's real smart.
Don't know where she gets it from.
I've been tryin' to figure that out for years.
Your daughter, she got a name? What? Your daughter? What's her name? Sarah.
Her name's Sarah.
To Sarah.
I recognize you.
Are you famous or somethin'? Uh, you might have seen me on TV, I, uh I found that Byers boy.
So, you on that case or what? I just saw him on patrol, you know? Dumb luck.
So that quarry, that's, uh that's state-run, where they found the boy, huh? Yeah.
Yeah, well, that's funny.
'Cause, you know, I know for a fact that it's run by the Sattler Company.
Frank Sattler? Decent guy, still got a couple operational quarries up in Roane.
- Is that right? - Yeah.
That's right.
So why are you lying to me, man? What's your problem, bud? I don't have a problem.
I'm just a concerned citizen.
Yeah? Well, stick your nose someplace else.
The kid is dead.
End of story.
Thanks for ruining the game, dick.
Okay Let's try this one more time.
Who told you to be out there? What were you doing out there? I don't know! I don't know.
They they just told me to call it in and not let anybody get too close.
Get close to what? The body.
Who do you work for? The NSA? Hawkins Lab? Who is that? - You're gonna get us both killed.
- Who is that? Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! Talk to me! I know you're here! Come on.
- Now what? - She'll find him.
Right, El? Eleven? Are you listening? That man before you I need you to find him.
- Hurt him? - No.
No, I don't want you to hurt him.
I want you to listen to him.
- Listen? - Yes.
I want you to listen to what he says and repeat his words back to me.
Just like we used to with those old nursery rhymes.
Do you remember? Hmm? Do you think you can do that for me? - Mmm-hmm.
- Good.
Begin.
Amulet.
Frigid.
Evolve.
Airplane.
Eleven? Repeat the words.
Apricot.
Peninsula.
Game.
Enchantment.
Mouse.
Balloon.
She's doing it.
- She's finding him! - This is crazy.
Calm down.
She just closed her eyes.
Holy What is that? Mom? Will? Mom? No way! - Mom - Will! Please Will! Will! Will Will! - Mom! - Will! I'm here! I'm here! - Oh, God - Mom! - Will! - Will, it's us! Are you there? Can you hear us? We're here! Hello? Mom? Why can't he hear us? I don't know! Baby - Mom? - Oh, God.
Will! Mom! Oh, thank God.
Baby Will Mom Mom, it's coming! Tell me where you are! How do I get to you? It's like home, but it's so dark It's so dark and empty.
And it's cold! Mom? Mom! Listen to me! I swear I'm gonna get to you, okay? But right now, I need you to hide.
Mom, please! No, no, listen! Listen, I I will find you, but you have to run now! Run! Run! - El, are you okay? - Oh! Can you move? Here, help her up.
This way! And you're Brightening.
Enlarging.
Hmm.
Did your mom say anything else? Like, um, where it might have gone to, or No, just that it came out of the wall.
How long does this take? Not long.
Have you been doing this a while? What? Photography? Yeah.
I guess I'd rather observe people than, you know Talk to them.
I know.
It's weird.
No! No, it is.
It's just, sometimes people don't really say what they're really thinking.
But you capture the right moment it says more.
What was I saying? What? When you took my picture.
I shouldn't have taken that.
I'm, uh I'm sorry.
It's just That's it.
That's what I saw.
My mom I thought she was crazy 'cause she said that's not Will's body.
That he's alive.
- And if he's alive - Then Barbara.
- Hey, Patty! - Hey, uh, need something, Chief? - Oh, you know, I forgot my hat.
- Oh.
I'll just be a minute.
Hey, I love that book.
It's a nasty mutt.
Hey, you can't be back here.
Yeah, I just got off the line with O'Bannon.
He said that he needs to see you at the station.
- It's some emergency - What the hell are you talking about? I don't work with O'Bannon.
Did I say O'Bannon? I meant Okay.
Babe Jesus, the hell happened? Lonnie.
----------
1 [door beeps] [woman] Thanks.
[indistinct chatter] [breathing heavily] [indistinct chatter] [sighs] [doorknob rattling] - No.
- [bangs door] [sighs] - [gun cocking] - Hands up.
Hands up! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Forgot all the cameras, bub? Look, Dr.
Brenner asked for me specifically.
Okay? How else do you think I got in here? [Hopper scoffs] What's your name again? It's Jim Hopper.
Chief Jim Hopper.
Yeah, I've got Jim Hopper [grunts] - [man on radio] Come again? - [grunts] [both panting] [indistinct radio chatter] Hey you mind if I borrow this one? - [beeps] - [door buzzing] [door locks] - [liquid pouring] - [Lonnie] Drink.
It'll calm your nerves.
Help you think straight, yeah? I don't know what to do.
I know.
I know.
[sniffs] This whole time I I could I could feel him.
He was He was so close.
He was he was right there.
- I knew he was alive.
- [thunder rumbles] Our hands our hands were almost touching.
Now it's like I uh [sobbing] God, it's like I can't feel him anymore.
- Don't look at me like that.
- Like what? Like how everybody is looking at me.
- Like I'm out of my damn mind.
- Hey.
You're not gonna like this, but I think you need to seriously consider the possibility that all this It's in your head.
[scoffs] - You remember your Aunt Darlene? - No.
No, this is not that.
I mean, when something like this happens, your mind makes up stuff for you to cope, you know? I mean, Jesus, there's a funeral tomorrow for our little boy and you're saying his body is fake.
He's in the wall.
I mean, how do you explain that? - [stammers] - It just doesn't make sense.
It doesn't.
- At least go talk to a shrink or - [sighs] - What about Pastor Charles or someone - I don't Well, they can't help.
Joyce, you just told me that Will is gone.
- What else is there to do? - [sniffles] Hey.
[sniffles] [Hopper] Will? Will? Will? Will? [Mike] What was Will saying? Like home Like home but dark? [Lucas] And empty.
[sighs] Empty and cold.
Wait, did he say cold? I don't know.
The stupid radio kept going in and out.
[sighs] It's like riddles in the dark.
Like home.
Like his house? Or maybe like Hawkins.
Upside down.
- What'd she say? - Upside down.
- [Lucas] What? - Upside down.
When El showed us where Will was, she flipped the board over, remember? Upside down.
Dark.
Empty.
Do you understand what he's talking about? - No.
- [Mike] Guys, come on, think about it.
When El took us to find Will, she took us to his house, right? Yeah.
And he wasn't there.
But what if he was there? What if we just couldn't see him? What if he was on the other side? What if this is Hawkins and this is where Will is? The Upside Down.
Like the Vale of Shadows.
[Hopper] Will? - Will? - [alarm blaring faintly] Will? [alarm continues] - [pressing button] - [indistinct chatter] [guards yelling] I see him! Hey! Stop! [Dustin] "The Vale of Shadows is a dimension that is a dark reflection or echo of our world.
It is a place of decay and death.
" [Hopper] Will? "A plane out of phase.
A place of monsters.
It is right next to you, and you don't even see it.
" - [electricity crackling] - [Hopper coughing] Will? Will? An alternate dimension.
But how how do we get there? You cast Shadow Walk.
In real life, dummy.
We can't shadow walk, but maybe she can.
Do you know how we get there? To the Upside Down? [sighing] Oh, my God! [coughing] [exclaims softly] What the hell? [rhythmic pulsing] [gasps] [Hopper] Hey! Hey! Hey! [theme music playing] Hey, kid.
What's going on? Your dad's, uh, gonna stay here tonight.
[stammers] On the couch.
[Lonnie] Yeah, I'm here as long as you need me, okay? How are you holding up? What happened? - Don't worry about that.
- Mom that thing you saw before, did it come back? Jonathan, that's enough.
[sighs] Can we talk? Alone? - You need to leave.
- Look, I know you're upset.
We all are.
But you need to listen to me.
Your mother is sick.
Really sick.
Yeah.
Well, you being here, you're just making things worse, like always.
- Worse? - Yeah! She took down that wall with an ax.
She said that Will was inside and that he's talking to her.
Yeah.
Maybe he was.
This isn't some kind of joke.
Your mom was half frozen to death when I got here.
Trembling, scared out of her mind.
You come in here and you start feeding into her hallucinations or whatever the hell you want to call it, you're gonna push her right over the edge.
You hear me? [sighs] Look, I'm on your side.
I'm here to help.
I'm gonna make things better around here for all of us.
[scoffs] Thank God you're here.
Do me a favor.
At the funeral tomorrow, just behave.
If not for me, for your mother.
Take that down.
It's inappropriate.
- Good.
- Ah! Dad, you're you're choking me.
Ah there.
It's supposed to be a little tight.
Looks good.
- [zipper closing] - Here we go.
[sighs] You look nice, sweetie.
Anything else? You can borrow my black heels if you want.
The ones you wore to Cathy's birthday.
I'm fine.
Thanks.
[whimpering] Ugh.
Come on.
Time to go.
[groans softly] - Come on.
- [sighs] [Pastor Charles] "Fear not, for I am with you.
Be not dismayed, for I am your God.
I will strengthen you.
Yes, I will help you.
I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.
" It's times like these that our faith is challenged.
How, if He is truly benevolent could God take from us someone so young, so innocent? It would be easy to turn away from God but we must remember that nothing, not even tragedy, can separate us from His love.
We are here today to find comfort in the truth of scripture, - and to surround Will and his family - [sniffles] Just wait till we tell Will that Jennifer Hayes was crying at his funeral.
[shushes] - [Karen] I'm so, so sorry.
- Oh, thank you so much for coming.
Yeah, if there's anything we can do I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.
Take care, all right? Thanks.
Thanks for coming out.
I see Will the Wise is back.
What's that shooting out of his cane? Fireballs.
I couldn't find the red crayon, so that's why it's green.
Oh, well if he's so wise, why does he need fireballs? Why can't he just, you know, outsmart the bad guys? Most of the time, yeah, totally.
But sometimes the bad guys are smart, too.
You know? Yeah.
So he needs the fireballs? Well, yeah, to burn them to a crisp.
All right.
Well, I don't know who's been raising you, but I'm gonna get you some new crayons because it looks like he's shooting cabbages.
[both chuckle] [gasping] [breathing heavily] [panting] [dishes clattering] [exclaims] [Lucas] Will! Will, it's us! Are you there? [Dustin] Can you hear us? We're here! [Will distorted] Hello? Mom? - [Lucas] Why can't he hear us? - [Mike] I don't know! [Will distorted] Mom, it's coming! She was there.
[church bell tolling] This is where we know for sure it's been, right? - So, that's - Steve's house.
And that's the woods where they found Will's bike and that's my house.
- It's all so close.
- Yeah.
Exactly.
I mean, it's all within a mile or something.
Whatever this thing is, it's it's not traveling far.
You want to go out there.
We might not find anything.
I found something.
And if we do see it then what? [sighs] We kill it.
- What are you doing? - Just give me a second.
Are you serious? What? You want to find this thing and take another photo? Yell at it? This is a terrible idea.
Yeah, well, it's the best we've got.
What? You can tell someone, but they're not gonna believe you.
You know that.
Your mom would.
- She's been through enough.
- She deserves to know.
Yeah, and I'll tell her when this thing is dead.
I don't know what in the world caused it.
- Let's take a look, huh? - Yeah.
Mr.
Clarke says he's never seen anything like it.
Mr.
Clarke? Yeah, he runs the AV Club.
[repairman] That right? Apparently, some of the less athletic types go nuts for this stuff.
[engine starting] [indistinct chatter] [Mike] Mr.
Clarke? Oh, hey, there.
How are you boys holding up? [munching] We're in mourning.
Man, these aren't real Nilla Wafers.
[Mike] We were wondering if you had time to talk? - We have some questions.
- A lot of questions.
So, you know how in Cosmos, Carl Sagan talks about other dimensions? Like, beyond our world? Yeah, sure.
Theoretically.
Right, theoretically.
So, theoretically, how do we travel there? You guys have been thinking about Hugh Everett's Many-Worlds Interpretation, haven't you? Well, basically, there are parallel universes.
Just like our world, but just infinite variations of it.
Which means there's a world out there where none of this tragic stuff ever happened.
Yeah, that's not what we're talking about.
- Oh.
- We were thinking of more of an evil dimension, like the Vale of Shadows.
You know the Vale of Shadows? An echo of the Material Plane, where necrotic and shadow magic [Mike] Yeah, exactly.
If that did exist, a place like the Vale of Shadows, how would we travel there? - Theoretically.
- [Mr.
Clarke] Well Picture an acrobat standing on a tightrope.
Now, the tightrope is our dimension.
And our dimension has rules.
You can move forwards, or backwards.
But, what if right next to our acrobat, there is a flea? Now, the flea can also travel back and forth, just like the acrobat.
- Right? - Right.
Here's where things get really interesting.
The flea can also travel this way along the side of the rope.
He can even go underneath the rope.
- [boys] Upside down.
- Exactly.
But we're not the flea, we're the acrobat.
In this metaphor, yes, we're the acrobat.
So we can't go upside down? No.
Well, is there any way for the acrobat to get to the Upside Down? Well you'd have to create a massive amount of energy.
More than humans are currently capable of creating, mind you, to open up some kind of tear in time and space, and then you create a doorway.
- Like a gate? - Sure.
Like a gate.
- But again, this is all - Theoretical.
But but what if this gate already existed? Well, if it did, I I think we'd know.
It would disrupt gravity, the magnetic field, our environment.
Heck, it might even swallow us up whole.
Science is neat.
But I'm afraid it's not very forgiving.
Whoa.
Hey, Chief! - [knocking] Hello? Whoa! - Hey! - [Powell] Jesus, Chief.
You all right? - What are you doing here? - We tried calling, but - Yeah, the phone's dead.
Hey, so Bev Mooney came in this morning all upset.
Said that Dale and Henry went hunting yesterday and they didn't come back home.
She thought they were on another binger, but she's not so sure now.
I think this whole Will Byers thing has everybody on edge.
- Where was this? - It was at the station.
No, no.
Where did Henry and Dale go hunting? Oh.
Uh, out near Kerley.
Mirkwood.
What? Okay.
You go back to the station.
I'll take care of this, all right? - Are you sure? - Yeah, leave it.
- Oh, hey.
Uh, they found Barbara's car.
- What? Barbara Holland's car.
Seems she ran away after all.
Staties found it late last night at a bus station.
Funny, right? They keep doing our job for us.
Yeah.
[chuckles] It's funny.
[door closes] - Is he off his meds again? - [engine starts] He's been spending too much time with Joyce Byers.
That's what I think.
[sighs] What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? You want to freeze to death all winter? [hammering continues] - I told you not to take these down.
- They were in the way, babe.
How long are you gonna keep those up? I mean, really? You know, it's a shame what they've done to this family.
- What? - The Sattler Company.
I went to the quarry on the way over here.
I just wanted to look around, you know? Couldn't believe it.
I just couldn't believe it.
No warning signs, no fence, no nothing.
Ought to be held accountable if you ask me.
It would take a lot of energy to build a gate like this.
But that's got to be what happened.
- Otherwise, how'd Will get there, right? - Right.
What we want to know is, do you know where the gate is? Then how do you know about the Upside Down? [Mike] Dustin, what are you doing? Dustin? - Dustin! - Dustin! - I I need to see your compasses.
- What? Your compasses.
All of your compasses, right now! What's exciting about this? - Well, they're all facing north, right? - Yeah, so? - Well, that's not true north.
- What do you mean? I mean exactly what I just said.
That's not true north.
Are you both seriously this dense? The sun rises in the east, and it sets in the west.
Right? Which means that's true north.
So what you're saying is the compasses are broken.
[sighs] Do you even understand how a compass works? - Do you see a battery pack on this? - No.
No, you don't.
Because it doesn't need one.
The needle's naturally drawn to the Earth's magnetic North Pole.
So what's wrong with them? Well, that's what I couldn't figure out, but then I remembered.
You can change the direction of a compass with a magnet.
If there's the presence of a more powerful magnetic field, the needle deflects to that power.
And then I remembered what Mr.
Clarke said.
The gate would have so much power It could disrupt the electromagnetic field.
Exactly.
Meaning, if we follow the compasses' north They should lead us to the gate.
[sighs] Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa.
- [exhales] What are you doing here? - What are you doing? - Nothing.
- I hope that's not meant for me.
What? No.
Oh, no, I was just - thinking about joining softball.
- Oh.
Well, uh listen, I'm really sorry.
I mean, even before you threatened me with the baseball bat.
Okay.
I panicked and [sighs] - I mean, I was a total dick.
- Yeah, you were.
[sighs] Did you get in trouble with your parents? Totally, but you know, who cares? Screw 'em.
Any news about Barbara? - Parents heard from her? Or - No.
Hey, listen.
Why don't we, uh, why don't we catch a movie tonight, you know? Just kinda pretend everything's normal for a few hours.
All The Right Moves is still playing.
You know, with your lover boy from Risky Business? [chuckles] Yeah, I know.
You know, Carol thinks I actually kinda look like him.
What do you think? Huh? Just take those old records Off the shelf I'll sit and listen to them by myself I just, I I don't think I can.
I've been really busy with this whole funeral thing and [inhales] with my brother.
It's been really hard on him.
Yeah, sure.
Sure, yeah, yeah.
So I should go.
Sorry.
I'll call you later.
Is that okay? Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
Just take those old records Off the shelf I'll sit and listen to them [sighs] [Joyce] You were here for the money! [Lonnie] No! The money! Admit it! You aren't here 'cause of Will.
You never cared about him.
You never did! Jesus, Joyce, it was his funeral today.
Do we have to do this right now? - I can't believe I fell for this.
- I'm here to help, Joyce.
- To help? - We could use that money for good.
[stammering] Oh, like maybe to pay off your debts? To pay for Jonathan to go to school! - Oh, don't do that.
- Do what? - Lie to me! - I'm not lying to you! Yeah, well, where does he wanna go? - Huh? - What? Where does Jonathan want to go to college? We get that money, anywhere he damn well pleases! NYU, Lonnie! He's wanted to go to NYU since he was six years old! So then he goes to NYU! Get out.
Get out! You need me here, Joyce.
[laughs] Oh, brother, I have not needed you for a long time! Oh, no? Look what happened.
[scoffs] Oh, don't you dare.
- At least I was here! - Oh, come on, Joyce.
Just look around at this place.
All your Christmas lights.
What the hell am I supposed to think? You're such a great mom? You're a mess! Maybe I am a mess.
Maybe I'm crazy.
Maybe I'm out of my mind! But, God help me, I will keep these lights up until the day I die if I think there's a chance that Will's still out there! Now, get out! Get out of my house! [sighs] [Nancy] You're supposed to hit the cans, right? No, actually, you see the spaces in between the cans? I'm aiming for those.
Ah.
You ever shot a gun before? - [scoffs] Have you met my parents? - [chuckles softly] Yeah, I haven't shot one since I was ten.
My dad took me hunting on my birthday.
He made me kill a rabbit.
- A rabbit? - Yeah.
I guess he thought it would make me into more of a man or something.
I cried for a week.
Jesus.
What? I'm a fan of Thumper.
[chuckles] I meant your dad.
Yeah.
I guess he and my mother loved each other at some point, but [gun cocks] I wasn't around for that part.
Um, yeah.
Just, uh, point and shoot.
I don't think my parents ever loved each other.
They must've married for some reason.
My mom was young.
My dad was older, but he had a cushy job, money, came from a good family.
So they bought a nice house at the end of the cul-de-sac and started their nuclear family.
Screw that.
Yeah.
Screw that.
- [beer can clatters] - [both chuckle] [dialing] [line ringing] - [woman] Hello? - Hey.
Jim? - Yeah.
- [sighs] Why are you calling me here? I told you not to call me.
I know, I know, I know.
I just wanted to I just wanted to hear your voice and, uh I just wanted to say that, um even after everything that happened, I don't I don't regret any of it.
And those seven years, they were everything to me.
Have you been drinking? No.
- No.
- [baby crying over phone] [woman shushing] Honey, hey Hey, it's okay it's okay.
[shushing] [crying continues] You know what, actually, I have been drinking, I'm sorry.
Jim, I can't Just take care of yourself, okay? Say hi to Bill for me.
Are you sure [phone ringing] [ringing stops] [sighs] How much further? I don't know.
These only tell direction, not distance.
You really need to learn more about compasses.
I'm just saying.
How do we know when we get to the gate? Uh, I think a portal to another dimension is gonna be pretty obvious.
[sighs] Do you think she's acting weird? You're asking if the weirdo is acting weird? I mean, weirder than normal? I don't know.
Who cares? [breathing heavily] How far, Papa? Farther than we've ever gone before.
- The bath? - Yes.
Yes, the bath.
Is that okay? Okay.
Mike.
Yeah? Turn back.
What? Why? I'm tired.
[sighs] Look, I'm sure we're almost there.
Just hold on a little longer, okay? [sighs] [Nancy] You never said what I was saying.
[Jonathan] What? [Nancy] Yesterday.
You said I was saying something and that's why you took my picture.
Oh, uh I don't know.
My guess I saw this girl, you know, trying to be someone else.
But for that moment it was like you were alone, or you thought you were.
And, you know, you could just be yourself.
That is such bullshit.
[stammers] What? I am not trying to be someone else.
Just because I'm dating Steve and you don't like him You know what? Forget it.
I just thought it was a good picture.
He's actually a good guy.
[stammers] Okay.
Yesterday, with the camera He's not like that at all.
He was just being protective.
Yeah, that's one word for it.
Oh, and I guess what you did was okay? No, I I never said that.
He had every right to be pissed Okay, all right.
Does that mean I have to like him? No.
Listen, don't take it so personally, okay? I don't like most people.
He's in the vast majority.
You know, I was actually starting to think that you were okay.
- Yeah? - Yeah.
Yeah, I was thinking, "Jonathan Byers, maybe he's not the pretentious creep everyone says he is.
" Well, I was just starting to think you were okay.
- Oh.
- I was thinking, "Nancy Wheeler, she's not just another suburban girl who thinks she's rebelling by doing exactly what every other suburban girl does until that phase passes and they marry some boring one-time jock who now works sales, and they live out a perfectly boring little life at the end of a cul-de-sac.
Exactly like their parents, who they thought were so depressing, but now, hey, they get it.
" [scoffs] [scoffs] [pounding on door] Go away, Lonnie.
[continues pounding] Seriously! I am gonna murd [whispers] What? What? [Hopper sighs] Oh, Jesus.
[scoffs] Oh, no.
"Oh, no"? What's, "Oh, no"? - We're headed back home.
- What? - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure.
Setting sun, right there.
We looped right back around.
And you're just realizing this now? - Why is this all on me? - Because you're the compass genius! What do yours say? [both] North.
- [Lucas sighs] - Makes no damn sense.
[sighs] Maybe the gate moved.
No, I don't think it's the gate.
I think it's something else screwing with the compasses.
Maybe it's something here.
No, it has to be like a super magnet.
It's not a magnet.
She's been acting weirder than normal.
If she can slam doors with her mind, she can definitely screw up a compass.
Why would she do that? Because she's trying to sabotage our mission.
Because she's a traitor! [Mike] Lucas, what are you doing? You did it, didn't you? You don't want us to reach the gate.
You don't want us to find Will.
[Mike] Lucas, come on, seriously, - just leave her alone! - Admit it.
- No.
- Admit it! - Fresh blood.
I knew it.
- Lucas, come on! I saw her wiping her nose on the tracks! She was using her powers! Bull! That's old blood.
Right, El? Right, El? [crying] It's not it's not safe.
- [Hopper panting] - [light bulbs clattering] [panting] Okay.
Should be okay, I mean I can't guarantee it, but it should be okay.
What the hell is going on, Hopper? They bugged my place.
- What? - They bugged my place.
They put a microphone in the light.
[sighs] It's because I'm on to them and they know it.
- I don't know - Who? I thought they might be watching you, too.
I don't know, the CIA, the NSA, Department of Energy I don't know.
You gotta explain this to me, 'cause I am not I went to the morgue last night, Joyce.
What? It wasn't him.
What? Will's body, it was a fake.
[Joyce exclaims] You were right.
This whole time, you were right.
What did I tell you? She's been playing us from the beginning! That's not true.
She helped us find Will! Find Will? Find Will? Where is he, then? Huh? I don't see him.
- Yeah, you know what I mean.
- No, I actually don't.
Just think about it, Mike.
She could've just told us where the Upside Down was right away, but she didn't.
She just made us run around like headless chickens.
- All right, calm down! - No! She used us, all of us! She helped just enough so she could get what she wants.
Food and a bed.
- She's like a stray dog.
- Screw you, Lucas! No! Screw you, Mike.
You're blind blind because you like that a girl's not grossed out by you.
But wake up, man! Wake the hell up! She knows where Will is, and now she's just letting him die in the Upside Down.
- Shut up! - For all we know, it's her fault.
Shut up.
We're looking for some stupid monster but did you ever stop to think that maybe she's the monster? I said shut up! [grunting] - Stop! - [Dustin] Knock it off, you idiots.
- Stop it! - [Dustin] Mike, get off! - Stop it! - [grunting] [screams] Jesus! Lucas! Lucas! Lucas, are you all right? - Lucas.

[indistinct whimper] [whimpering continues] - [Nancy] Oh, God.
- [whimpering] [Jonathan sighs] [Nancy] It's been hit by a car.
We can't just leave it.
[whimpering] I'll do it.
- I thought you said - I'm not nine anymore.
[sighs] - [cocks gun] - [breathing heavily] [both gasping] What was that? [both panting] [Nancy] Where'd it go? I don't know.
Do you see any more blood? No.
[liquid dripping] Jonathan? - [snarling] - [gasps] [gnawing] - [twig snaps] - [roars] [screams] [gasps] Nancy! Nancy? Nancy? Nancy, where are you? Nancy! Nancy! [rock music playing]

[theme music playing] [pop song playing on car stereo] I just don't understand why we're coming out here.
She obviously doesn't wanna talk to you.
That's that's not it.
Oh, really? Because no girl would ever blow off King Steve.
She was acting weird.
I mean, something was wrong.
So what? [scoffs] Like, you're worried about her? - What? - Aw, you are.
- Aw, Steve has a heart.
- Would you just Stop.
- Oh, Stevey's in love.
- Would you just shut up? - Who knew? - Shut up! [chuckling] Jeez.
- [Carol] Damn.
Sorry.
- [Tommy chuckles] [sighs] So this is it, huh? Princess' castle.
[Steve] I'll just be a minute.
[Joyce] Look, we gotta go through this again.
- I told you everything that I saw.
- Oh, gosh.
Tell me again.
- Upstairs or downstairs? - Upstairs.
There was a laboratory.
It was where they must do experiments or something, and then there was [inhales deeply] There was this kid's room.
- How do you know it was a kid's room? - More like a prison.
So why would you think it was a kid's room, then? Because, I told you, the size of the bed, there was a drawing, there was a stuffed animal [stammers] You didn't say there was a drawing.
Yeah, there was a drawing of a an adult and a child.
- It said "Eleven" on it.
- Was it good? It was a kid's drawing, Joyce.
It was stick figures.
[sighs] Wasn't Will.
Earl The night that Benny died, Earl said he saw some kid with a shaved head with Benny.
Now, I pressed him, he said it might be Will, but maybe Wait Maybe, it wasn't? Look this woman, Terry Ives, she claims to have lost her daughter, Jane.
She sued Brenner, she sued the government Now, the claims came to nothing, but what if I mean, what if this whole time I've been I've been looking for Will I've been chasing after some other kid? - [Jonathan gasps] - [monster growling] - [growling] - [gasps] [Jonathan] Nancy! [monster growls] Better? Yeah.
Is this okay? Uh, I found it in the closet.
I can go home.
[stammers] I just figured Yeah, no.
I [stammers] - I don't wanna be alone.
- [sighs] - Do you? - No.
Uh no.
[sighs] Can you just come up here? Yeah.
- Do you want the lights off, or - [softly] On.
[softly] Yeah.
You know, it it can't get us in here.
We don't know that.
Uh, yeah, it's Ives.
Terry Ives.
That's with a "Y.
" Yeah, I got a pen.
Hang on.
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Great, thanks.
I really appreciate this, Frank.
Say hi to the boys for me, too, would you? Did you get it? - I got it.
- Okay.
[grunting softly] [pages rustling] Oh Hey.
[Nancy] Hey.
[grunts] Couldn't sleep? Every time I close my eyes, I just keep seeing that thing.
Wherever I was, that place I think that it lives there.
It was feeding there.
Feeding on that deer.
That means that if [inhales deeply] if Will and Barbara Hey.
My mom said she talked to Will.
If he's alive, there's a chance Barbara is, too.
That means that she's trapped in that place.
We have to find it again.
You wanna go back out there? Maybe we don't have to.
When I saw it, it was feeding on that deer.
- Meaning it's it's a predator, right? - Right.
And it seems to hunt at night, like a a lion or a coyote.
But it doesn't hunt in packs like them.
It's always alone, like like a bear.
And remember at Steve's, when Barb cut herself? - And then, last night, the deer - Hmm, it was bleeding, too.
One sec.
Sharks can detect blood in one part per million.
That's one drop of blood in a million, and they can smell it from a quarter mile away.
So you're saying it can detect blood? [softly] It's just a theory.
We could test it.
But if it works At least we'll know it's coming.
- [door knob rattles] - [both gasp] - [Nancy sighs] - [Karen] Honey, are you up? Yeah, I'm I'm getting dressed.
[Karen] I, uh, made some blueberry pancakes.
I'll be down in a second.
- [footsteps receding] - [sighing] [Jonathan sighing] - [sighs] - Your mom doesn't knock? [both chuckle] [knocking on door] - Hi.
Scott Clarke? - Uh, yes.
The same Scott Clarke who teaches science and AV - at Hawkins Middle? - The very same.
Oh, wonderful.
And we're making a newsletter, which we'll send out monthly.
It'll showcase all the latest equipment, as well as how-to articles, which the kids write themselves.
Oh, that's neat.
What we're really trying to do here, Mr.
Clarke Uh, please, call me Scott.
Scott.
What we're trying to do here, Scott, is to connect kids from all over the state and give them the support and encouragement to pursue careers in technology.
We feel these are the kinds of kids that are going to make Indiana proud.
I agree, yes.
Completely.
So, you know any kids you think might wanna participate? Oh, I have a few in mind.
[Mike sighs] I just I can't believe she didn't come back.
- [Dustin] She's gotta be close.
- She said it wasn't safe.
She just messed up the compasses because she wanted to protect us.
- She didn't betray us.
- Mike, calm down.
I shouldn't have yelled at her.
I never should've done that.
- Mike, this isn't your fault.
- Yeah, it's Lucas'.
It wasn't his fault, either.
- It wasn't his fault? - No.
So you're saying he wasn't way out of line? - Totally, but so were you! - What? - And so was Eleven.
- Oh, give me a break! No, Mike, you give me a break! All three of you were being a bunch of little assholes! I was the only reasonable one.
But the bottom line is you pushed first.
And you know the rule.
You draw first blood No! No way! I'm not shaking his hand.
- You're shaking his hand! - No, I'm not.
This isn't a discussion.
This is the rule of law.
Obey or be banished from the party.
Do you wanna be banished? - No.
- Good.
Where are we going? Where do you think? We're going to get Lucas.
And then we're gonna find Eleven.
[door opens] [breathing heavily] Today is a very special day.
Do you know why? Because today, we make history.
Today, we make contact.
[breathing heavily] [birds chirping] [sighing] [breathing heavily] [screams] [birds chirping] [Karen] Here you go.
Ah yum.
Okay.
Now, sweetie, swallow the pancake.
Where is Nancy? I thought she was coming down.
[sighs] She is.
Uh, she was.
I don't know.
- Nancy, what's taking so long? - [music playing faintly] Nancy? - [door knob rattles] - [sighs] Nancy, come on.
- [sighs] - [music continues] Nan [doorbell rings] What do you want? [sighs] I drew first blood, so Okay, I'll shake.
On one condition.
We forget the weirdo and go straight to the gate.
- Then the deal's off.
- Fine! - Fine! - [Dustin] No, no, not fine! Guys, seriously? Do you even remember what happened on the Bloodstone Pass? [sighs] We couldn't agree on what path to take, so we split up the party and those trolls took us out one by one.
And it all went to shit.
And we were all disabled! So we stick together, no matter what! Yeah, I agree.
But this is the party, right here in this room.
- El is one of us now.
- Um, no, she's not.
Not even close! Never will be.
She's a liar, a traitor She was just trying to keep us safe! She didn't mean to hurt you.
It was an accident! An accident? All right, accident or not - admit it, it was a little awesome.
- Awesome? Yeah, she threw you in the air with her mind! I could have been killed! Which is exactly why we need her.
She's a weapon! Do you seriously wanna fight the Demogorgon with your wrist rocket? That's like R2-D2 going to fight Darth Vader.
We're no use to Will if we're dead.
If you two wanna waste your time looking for a traitor, go ahead, 'cause I'm not spending my time on her anymore.
No way! I'm going to the gate.
I'm gonna find Will.
[upbeat music playing on PA] [indistinct chatter] [Dr.
Brenner] It's okay, Eleven.
Don't be frightened.
These are all friends.
They're just here to watch.
Don't focus on them.
Stay in here, like before.
Yes, Papa.
Now, remember.
Whatever it is, it can't hurt you.
Not from here.
So there's nothing to be frightened of.
It's reaching out to you 'cause it wants you.
Hmm? It's calling you so don't turn away from it this time.
I want you to find it.
Understand? Yes.
[man] Are you lost? Is your mom here? Your dad? Mouth breather.
- What should we do? - Uh Call the police.
Excuse me.
Young lady! You know you have to pay for those! - Hey! Stop right - [woman screams] - Please.
- [woman grunts] [stammers] You have to pay for those! Stop right there! Thief! Thief! - [glass shattering] - [clamoring] Can I help you? Hi, we're looking for Terry Ives.
Does she live here? - Who's asking? - The Hawkins chief of police.
And you want to talk to my sister? Well, if your sister's Terry Ives, then, yeah, we do.
Okay, well, you can come in, but if you want Terry to tell you anything, you're about five years too late.
[TV playing indistinctly] Terry, you have some visitors.
Hello.
My name's Joyce Byers.
Uh, this is Hopper.
We drove over from Hawkins.
Um, you see, uh, my son he's been missing for almost a week now, and, um, we were wondering if we could talk to you about your daughter, Jane? If there's anything that you could tell us about when she was taken What was your relationship with Dr.
Brenner? You guys keep in touch? This is, uh this is him.
[stammering] This is Will.
Uh, you may have seen him on on the news.
- Uh - What's wrong with her? I told you, you're wasting your time.
[Dustin] This is weird without Lucas.
- He should've shaken my hand.
- He's just jealous.
What are you talking about? [sighs] Sometimes, your total obliviousness just blows my mind.
He's your best friend, right? - Yeah I mean, I don't know.
- It's fine.
I get it.
I didn't get here until the fourth grade.
He had the advantage of living next door.
But none of that matters.
What matters is that he is your best friend.
And then this girl shows up and starts living in your basement, and all you ever want to do is pay attention to her.
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.
And you know it.
And he knows it.
But no one ever says anything until you both start punching and yelling at each other like goblins with intelligence scores of zero.
- Now everything's weird.
- He's not my best friend.
- [chuckles] Yeah, right.
- [sighs] I mean, he is, but so are you.
- And so is Will.
- Can't have more than one best friend.
- Says who? - Says logic.
Well, I call bull on your logic, because you're my best friend, too.
Okay.
[panting] Whoa.
- [indistinct conversations] - [Dustin] You don't think [panting] Uh definitely.
[audience applauding on TV] [host on TV] Are you ready? [Becky] She was a part of some study in college.
- MK Ultra? - Yeah, that's the one.
[exhales] Was, uh, started in the '50s.
By the time Terry got involved, it was supposed to be ramping down, but the drugs just got crazier.
Messed her up good.
This was the CIA that ran this? You and Terry would've gotten along.
"The Man," with a big capital "M.
" [sighing] They'd pay you know, a couple hundred bucks to people like my sister, give 'em drugs, psychedelics.
LSD, mostly.
And then they'd strip her naked and put her in these isolation tanks.
- Isolation tanks? - [Becky] Yeah.
These big bathtubs, basically, filled with salt water, so you can float around in there.
You lose any sense of, uh sense and feel nothing, see nothing.
They wanted to expand the boundaries of the mind.
Real hippie crap.
I I mean, it's not like they were forcing her to do any of this stuff.
The thing is, though, is that she didn't know she was pregnant at the time.
Jane.
[sighs] Do you have any pictures of her? I don't think you guys understand.
Terry miscarried in the third trimester.
She keeps all of this up.
Been doing it for 12 years.
[sighs] Terry, uh, pretends like Jane is real, - like she's gonna come home someday.
- [lullaby plays from mobile] Says she's special.
Born with "abilities.
" Abilities? [bones cracking] You read any Stephen King? - [hisses] - [beeping] [stammers] [chuckles] You guys look scared, actually.
[chuckles] I mean, it's all make-believe.
[clears throat] What what kind of abilities? Telepathy, telekinesis [Eleven screams] You know, shit you can do with your mind.
That's why the big, bad Man stole Jane away.
[yelling] Papa! Her baby's a weapon, off fighting the commies.
You know, the doctors all say it's a coping mechanism.
You know, to deal with the guilt.
Do you think there is any chance she could be telling the truth? [stammering] About having had the kid.
There is no birth certificate, nothing from the hospital.
Doctors and nurses all confirm that she miscarried.
Yeah, but that could've been covered up.
Right? Like I said, you and Terry would've gotten along.
Oh, man.
[grunts] [clattering] And I'll have four boxes of the .
38s.
What you kids doin' with all this? Um - Monster hunting.
- Huh.
[scoffs] [cash register dings] "Monster hunting"? You know, last week I was shopping for a new top I thought Steve might like.
It took me and Barb all weekend.
It seemed like life or death, you know? And and now You're shopping for bear traps with Jonathan Byers.
Yeah.
What's the weirdest part? Me or the bear trap? You.
It's definitely you.
[chuckles] - [car horn honking] - [Reed] Hey, Nance! Can't wait to see your movie.
[laughs] What the hell was that? I don't know.
What? What? Hey! Where are you going? - [panting] - Nancy, wait! [whimpers] Nancy! - [man 1] I can't believe it.
- [man 2] These kids! - [Jonathan] Jesus.
- [sighs] Wow.
- [spray can hissing] - [Tommy laughing] [Jonathan] Wait! [Carol] Tommy, you write like a three-year-old.
- [Tommy] Shut up! - [Nicole] I didn't know you could spell.
[Tommy speaks indistinctly] [indistinct chatter] [laughter] Aw, hey there, princess! [Tommy] Uh-oh! She looks upset.
[Carol] Oh! [Tommy] Damn! What is wrong with you? What's wrong with me? What's wrong with you? I was worried about you.
I can't believe that I was actually worried about you.
[scoffs] - What are you talking about? - I wouldn't lie if I were you.
You don't want to be known as the lying slut now, do you? Speak of the devil.
Hi.
You came by last night? Ding! Ding! Ding! Does she get a prize? Look, I don't know what you think you saw, but it wasn't like that.
What, you just let him into your room to study? Or for another pervy photo session? [laughs] - We were just - [Steve] You were just what? Finish that sentence.
Finish the sentence.
[breathing heavily] [scoffs] Go to hell, Nancy.
Come on, Nancy, let's just leave.
You know what, Byers? I'm actually kind of impressed.
I always took you for a queer, but I guess you're just a little screw-up like your father.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that house is full of screw-ups.
You know, I guess I shouldn't really be surprised.
A bunch of screw-ups in your family.
- Jonathan, leave it.
- I mean, your mom I'm not even surprised what happened to your brother.
[Nancy] Steve, shut up! I'm sorry I have to be the one to tell you, but the Byers, their family, it's a disgrace to the entire [grunts] - [groans] - [Jonathan breathing heavily] - [grunts] - [Nancy] Steve! - [Tommy] Oh! - [both grunting] - [Nancy] Steve.
- [groans] Stop! Steve! Knock it off, you guys! - [Carol] Get off of him, seriously! - Kick his ass, man! - [Carol] Get off! Stop! - [both continue grunting] Get in there, he's going to hurt himself! Hey.
Hey! Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here! [both grunting] Jonathan, stop! Stop! You're going to hurt him! - Jonathan, stop! - [sirens wailing] [Tommy] Cops! [Nancy] Guys Jonathan, get off of him! - Stop it! - [Tommy] Cops! Come on! - Stop it! Come on! - Cops! - You have to stop! - Just go, Carol! - [Nancy] Stop it! - [both grunting] Hey, he's had enough, man! I said he's had enough! - Kids! All right! - Stop it!

We appreciate it.
[Becky] Hmm, yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.
[door opens] - Good luck.
- [Hopper] Thank you.
[sighing] Hey [softly] What? We're gonna find him.
Yeah, like Terry found her daughter? We're close.
[breath trembling] Twelve years? Twelve years she's been looking for her And then she shows up at Benny's five nights ago, which means we've got a chance.
You know what I would give? For a chance? You know what I would give? [Callahan over radio] Hey, Chief, you there? - Hey, Chief? - Yeah, go ahead.
Yeah, a fight broke out here and - Cal, I don't have time for this.
- It's Jonathan Byers.
You haven't seen Joyce, have you? Do you think we'll be out of here soon? You, yes.
Him, no.
He assaulted a police officer.
- [ice cubes clatter] - Well, how long are you gonna keep him? You and your boyfriend have big plans, do you? [chuckles] He's not my boyfriend.
I think you better tell him that.
What? Only love makes you that crazy, sweetheart.
And that damn stupid.
[sighs] Found some ice.
Thanks.
[sniffs] [sighs] Everything okay? Yeah.
Everything's fine.

Do you remember how he said he was looking for the gate? - [Mike] Yeah.
- What if he found it? [Lucas shouting indistinctly on radio] What's he saying? I don't know, he's way out of range.
[Lucas] son of a bitch! Lucas, if you can hear us, slow down.
We can't understand you.
Yes, I copy! Do you? They know about Eleven! Get out of there! They know about Eleven! The bad men are coming! All of them! Do you hear me? The bad men are coming! "Mad hen.
" Does that mean anything to you? Like a code name or something? - [Lucas] The bad men are coming! - "Bad men.
" - Bad men! - [radio static] [gasps] Stay here.
[Mike] What's that guy doing? You don't think Well, I know she and Steve have been spending some time together, - so I thought maybe - Mom! [stammers] Well, is he home? - Maybe you could ask him? - Mom! I'm sorry, can you just hold on, please? Michael, I'm on the phone.
I've told you a million times - Did you schedule any repairs? - What? Is there anyone supposed to come and do repairs on the house? I don't understand.
Is there something wrong - No, Mom, nothing's wrong in the house.
- [Dustin] Mike! - One second.

Friends friends don't lie.
I'm sorry, too.
[Mike] Me, too.
[theme music playing] Hey.
Jonathan? Jesus, what what happened? - [Callahan] Ma'am - I'm fine.
Why is he wearing handcuffs? Well, your boy assaulted a police officer.
That's why.
- Take them off.
- I am afraid I cannot do that.
- Take them off! - You heard her.
Take 'em off.
Chief, I get everyone's emotional here, but there's something you need to see.
What is this? Why don't you ask your son? We found it in his car.
- What? - Why are you going through my car? Is that really the question you should be asking right now? I wanna see you in my office.
You won't believe me.
[softly] Why don't you give me a try? Mike? Mike? [sighs] [doorbell rings] Yeah, just a minute, please! - [under breath] Jiminy Christmas.
- [doorbell continues ringing] Hold your horses.
Mr.
Wheeler? Yes? [men speaking indistinctly] [Karen stuttering] I don't understand.
You think my son is hiding this girl? What happened to her hair? We just need to know if you've seen her in the past week.
- No, no.
- Absolutely not.
Our son with a girl? [chuckles] I mean, believe me, if he had a girl sleeping in this house, we'd know about it.
Wouldn't we? [Karen sighs] This girl what has she done? I'm afraid I can't answer that.
- Oh, my God, is she Russian? - [stammers] - You can't treat us like this.
- I need you to stay calm.
You come into my house, and you tell me that my son is hiding some girl, and that he's in danger, but you can't tell us why? And you, what, you expect me to remain, what, calm? [sighs] I understand how upsetting this is.
I wish we could tell you more but I can tell you that your son, Michael, is in real danger.
We want to help him.
We will help him.
I give you my word.
But in order for me to do that you have to trust me.
Will you trust me? Good.
Now do you have any idea where your son might have gone? [Lucas] This is Randolph Road, right here.
The fence starts here, and goes all the way around.
And this is the lab right here.
The gate's gotta be in there somewhere.
It's gotta be.
[Dustin] Well, who owns Hawkins Lab? The sign says "Department of Energy.
" Department of Energy? What do you think that means? It means government.
Military.
- [Dustin] Then why does it say "Energy"? - Just trust me, all right? It's military.
My dad's told me before.
Mike's right.
There's soldiers out front.
Do they make, like, lightbulbs or something? [Mike] No, weapons to fight the Russians, and commies and stuff.
[Lucas] Weapons.
[gasps] Oh, Jesus, this is bad.
Really bad.
The place is like a fortress.
Well, what do we do? [Mike] I don't know, but we can't go home.
We're fugitives now.
[helicopter approaching] [stutters] Guys? Do you hear that? - [Mike] Go, go, go, go! - [Dustin] Come on, come on! - It's stuck.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go! - [Mike] Hurry up! Hurry, come on! - [Lucas] Come on! [Dustin] Go, go, go, go, go, go! [helicopter whirring] - [panting] - [Lucas] Get down! [helicopter receding] Mental.
[Joyce sighs] You say blood draws this thing? We don't know.
It's just a theory.
[Jonathan] I'm sorry, Mom.
What, you're sorry? You're you're sorry? - That is not good enough, Jonathan.
- I know.
That's not even close.
That's not even in the in the ballpark.
I wanted to tell you, I just What if this thing took you, too? You risked your life and Nancy's.
[stammers] I thought I could save Will I still do.
This is not yours to fix alone.
[stammers] You act like you're all alone out there in the world, but you're not.
You're not alone.
I know.
[sighs] God damn it, Jonathan.
- I know.
- Damn it.
[sniffling] [Troy's mom] I want an apology! [Callahan] An apology for what, exactly? [Troy's mom] Where is the chief? I want to speak to him - right this instant.
- Stay here.
Ma'am, I need you to calm down.
What is your name, Deputy? Well, I'm an officer [chuckles] okay? [Troy's mom] Name and badge number, both of you! - What the hell is going on here? - [Powell] Chief These men are humiliating my son.
- No, no, no.
Okay, that's not true.
- Yes.
There was some kind of fight, Chief A psychotic child broke his arm! - A little girl, Chief.
A little one.
- That tone! Do you hear that tone? Honestly, I'm just trying to state a fact.
- I don't have time for this.
- It was a little girl Will you please take a statement [mouthing] and get her out? - [Callahan] Yes.
- So what'd this girl look like? She had no hair and she was bleeding from her nose.
Like a freak.
What'd you just say? I said she's a freak! No, her hair.
What'd you say about her hair? Her head's shaved.
She doesn't even look like a girl.
And And what? Tell the man, Troy.
She can do things.
What kind of things? Like make you fly.
And piss yourself.
What? Was she alone? She always hangs out with those losers.
"Losers"? What losers? Hey.
You owe me $1.
20.
Don't worry, he'll need more than aspirin when we're done with him.
Yeah, if the creep ever gets out.
The cops should just lock him up forever.
- Did you see the look on his face? - [Steve groans] - Oh.
- [chuckles] He probably had that same look whenever he killed his brother, right? Oh, God, I just got an image of him making that face - while he and Nancy are screwing.
- [chuckles] Carol, for once in your life, shut your damn mouth! - What? - Hey, what's your problem, man? You're both assholes.
That's my problem.
- Are you serious right now, man? - Yeah, I'm serious.
You shouldn't have done that.
- Done what? - You know what.
You mean call her out for what she really is? Oh, that's funny, because I don't remember you asking me to stop.
I should've put that spray paint right down your throat.
- What the hell, Steve? - [Steve] You know, neither of you ever cared about her.
You never even liked her, because she's not miserable like you two.
She actually cares about other people.
The slut with a heart of gold.
I told you to watch your mouth! Hey! I don't know what's gotten into you, man, - but you don't talk to her that way.
- Get out of my face.
- Or what? - [grunts] Or what? You gonna fight me now, too? Huh? You gonna fight me now, too? Because you couldn't take Jonathan Byers so I wouldn't recommend that.
[car door opens] Here, let me get the door for you, buddy.
That's right.
Run away, Stevie boy! Run away! Just like you always do.
That Nancy's turning you into a little pussy! - [tires screeching] - That's right, Harrington, run away! Run away! [scoffs] [Nancy] I have to go home.
No, you can't.
- My mom my dad are there.
- They're gonna be okay.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Let go.
- Let go! - Hey! Listen to me.
Listen to me.
The last thing in the world we need is them knowing you're mixed up in all this.
- Mike is over there - They haven't found him.
Not yet, at least.
[helicopter whirring] - For Mike? - Come on, get in the car.
Look, we need to find them before they do.
Do you have any idea where he might have gone? - No, I don't.
- I need you to think.
I don't know.
We haven't talked a lot.
I mean, lately [sighs] Is there any place that your your parents don't know about that he might go? - [stuttering] I don't know.
- I might.
What? I don't know where he is, but I think I know how to ask him.
Whoa.
I got it.
[helicopter hovering] [Nancy on radio] Mike, are you there? Mike? You guys hear that? Mike, it's me, Nancy.
Mike, are you there? Answer.
Mike, we need you to answer.
Is that your sister? This is an emergency, Mike.
Do you copy? Mike, do you copy? Okay, this is really weird.
Don't answer.
- She said it was an emergency.
- What if it's a trick? - It's your sister! - What if the bad people kidnapped her? What if they're forcing her to say this? I need you to answer.
It's like Lando Calrissian.
Don't answer.
We need to know that you're there, Mike.
Listen, kid, this is the chief.
If you're there, pick up.
We know you're in trouble and we know about the girl.
Why is she with the chief? How the hell does he know about [Hopper] We can protect you, we can help you, but you gotta pick up.
Are you there? Do you copy? Over.
[sighs] Anybody got any other ideas? [Mike] Yeah, I copy.
It's Mike.
I'm here.
We're here.
[Steve] Need a hand? Did you have something to do with this? I just I wanna help.
All yours.
[sighs] They expect us to just sit here like prisoners.
We should be out there looking for him.
Honey, we have to trust them, okay? This is our government.
They're on our side.
[Karen sighs] That man gives me the creeps.
Nancy.
You don't think she's involved in this, too, do you? Nancy with Mike? [chuckles] No.
- No.
- [sighs] [Dustin breathing heavily] Will you stop pacing? It's been way too long.
Do you know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe this is all a trap and the bad men are coming to get us right now! It's not a trap.
Why would the chief set us up? Nancy, maybe, but the chief? Lando Calrissian.
Would you shut up about Lando? I don't feel good about this.
I don't feel good about this! [shouting] When do you feel good about anything? [vehicles approaching] [Dustin] Shit! [Mike] Go, go, go, go.
[panting] Lando.
You think they saw us? Both of you, shut up.
[grunts] - [man 1] Hey! - [blows landing] [man 1 grunts] [man 2] What the [grunting] [door creaks] [breathing heavily] All right, let's go.
Let's go! Mike.
Oh, my God.
Mike! I was so worried about you.
Yeah, uh me, too.
Is that my dress? Okay, so, in this example, we're the acrobat.
Will and Barbara, and that monster, they're this flea.
And this is the Upside Down, where Will is hiding.
Mr.
Clarke said the only way to get there is through a rip of time and space.
- A gate.
- That we tracked to Hawkins Lab.
With our compasses.
Okay, so the gate has a really strong electromagnetic field, and that can change the directions of a compass needle.
Is this gate underground? [Eleven] Yes.
Near a large water tank? Yes.
[stutters] How do you know all that? He's seen it.
[Joyce] Is there any way that you could that you could reach Will? That you could talk to him in this The Upside Down.
[whispering] Down.
Yeah.
[Nancy] And my friend Barbara? Can you find her, too? [static] [static increases] [static becomes faint] I'm sorry.
What? [stuttering] What's wrong? What happened? [voice breaks] I can't find them.
[turns faucet off] [Mike] Whenever she uses her powers, she gets weak.
The more energy she uses, the more tired she gets.
- Like, she flipped the van earlier.
- It was awesome.
- But she's drained.
- Like a bad battery.
Well [stutters] How do we make her better? We don't.
We just have to wait and try again.
[Nancy] Well, how long? I don't know.
[Eleven] The bath.
[Joyce] What? I can find them.
In the bath.
[screaming] [woman] Oh! Oh.
Oh, my No, mmm-mmm.
Hey, you know how they did that? You know what that is? [sighing] No, what? Melted plastic and microwaved bubble gum.
[woman] No way.
Really? Really.
[phone ringing] - What in the world? - Do you want me to pause it? I'm sure it's just a wrong number.
Hello? Mr.
Clarke? It's Dustin.
Dustin? Is everything okay? Yeah, yeah.
I just, I I have a science question.
It's ten o'clock on Saturday.
Why don't we pick this up Do you know anything about sensory deprivation tanks? Specifically how to build one? Sensory deprivation? [stutters] What is this for? Fun.
Okay.
Well Why don't we talk about it Monday? After school, okay? You always say we should never stop being curious.
To always open any curiosity door we find.
Dustin Why are you keeping this curiosity door locked? [sighs] Uh-huh.
[indistinct chatter over phone] Uh-huh.
How much? Uh-huh.
Yep, all right.
Yeah, we'll be careful.
Definitely.
All right, Mr.
Clarke.
Yeah, I'll see you on Monday.
I'll see you on Monday, Mr.
Clarke.
Bye.
Do you still have that kiddie pool we bobbed for apples in? - I think so.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Good.
Then we just need salt.
Lots of it.
How much is "lots"? 1,500 pounds.
Well, where are we gonna get that much salt? [Jonathan grunting] Hey, wait.
It's not gonna snow next week, is it? [sighs] Worst case, no school.
Even if we find Will in there what are we gonna do about that thing? We're not gonna do anything.
I don't want you anywhere near this, all right? Your mom's been through enough already.
He's my brother.
Listen to me.
I'm gonna find him.
All right? You gotta trust me on this.
I am going to find him.
[grunting] This damn thing is heavy.
Come on.
It's upside down.
[Lucas] No, this way.
- Okay, um - How does this even work? - Try that side.
- [grunts] Son of a bitch! - Pull it back.
Pull it back.
- I am! - [Lucas] One, two, three.
- [grunts] Shit! [grunts] Ah.
[Nancy] Stand back.
Whoa.
[Nancy] What did she even eat? - [Mike] What? - Eleven.
[Mike] Oh.
Candy, leftovers, Eggos She really likes Eggos.
[Nancy] I knew you were acting weird.
I just I thought it was because of Will.
I knew you were acting weird, too.
I thought it was 'cause of Steve.
Hey No more secrets, okay? From now on we tell each other everything.
Okay.
Do you like Jonathan now? What? No.
No, it's it's not it's not like that.
Do you like Eleven? What? No.
Ew.
Gross.
This will keep it dark for you.
Just like in your bathtub.
[sighs] You're a very brave girl.
You know that, don't you? Everything you're doing for my boy for Will for my family [sighs] [sniffs] Thank you.
Listen.
I am gonna be there with you the whole time.
And if it ever gets too scary [stutters] in that place, you just let me know, okay? Yes.
Ready? [breath trembling] Ready.
Colder! Warmer! Right there! [static] [sighs] [electricity surging] [breathing heavily] Barb? Barbara? [breathing heavily] [squelching] [bubbling] [gasps] [breathing heavily] [electricity pulsating] - What's going on? - I don't know.

You did so good.
- Are you okay? - [Eleven cries] [Hopper sighs] So this fort.
Where is it? [stutters] Uh, it's in the woods behind our house.
Yeah, he used to go there to hide.
Hey, get back inside.
What, are you insane? - No, I'm - Look, if something happens to me, I don't make it back Yeah, but then I'll go.
You stay.
Are you kidding me? He's my son, Hop.

- [Hopper] Joyce, come on! - Please.
I'm gonna find him.
I'm gonna find him.
[engine starting] [door closes] [tires screeching] [door opens] [door slams] We have to go back to the station.
What? Your mom and Hopper are just walking in there like bait.
That thing is still in there.
And we can't just sit here and let it get them, too.
We can't.
[sighs] You still wanna try it out? I wanna finish what we started.
I want to kill it.
So this is your plan? Worked for me before, didn't it? - Well, did it? - Come on, trust me.
[announcer on radio] I'd like to hear your thoughts on the war.
I think we're dealing with a whole different environment here.
[announcer 2] I'll tell you what, we always planned on the Russians massing the fire and we [Hopper sighs] - [Joyce gasps] - [man] Don't move! - All right, move in.
- [guns cocking] It's all right.
Let me do the talking.
[indistinct radio chatter] [Will softly] If I go there will be trouble [shuddering] And if I stay it will be double So, come on and let me know Should I stay or should I go now? [monster growling] [footsteps approaching] [growling continues] [breathing heavily] [growling] [growling stops] [monster growls] 
----------
[insects chirping] [Joyce yelling] Let me out of here! Somebody, please! [grunts] Let me out! [door unlocking] [Joyce breathing heavily] [Dr.
Brenner] Your son.
We know you've been in contact with him.
- [stammering] You have to let me - When and how did you make contact with him? - What? - Hmm? Six.
What? Six.
Six people have been taken this week.
This thing that took your son [softly] we don't really understand it.
But its behavior is predictable.
Like all animals it eats.
It will take more sons.
More daughters.
I want to save them.
I want to save your son.
But I can't do that.
Not without your help.
Stop.
I know who you are.
I know what you've done.
You took my boy away from me! You left him in that place to die! You faked his death! We had a funeral.
We buried him.
And now you're asking for my help? Go to hell.
- [electricity crackling] - [groaning] - [breathing heavily] - Okay, now what do you know? I'm sorry.
Did I stutter? I told you.
Everything.
[electricity crackling] What do you know? [panting] I know you do experiments on kidnapped little kids, whose parents' brains you've turned to mush.
And I know you went a little too far this time and you messed up in a big way.
I mean, you really messed up, didn't you? Big time.
That's why you're trying to cover your tracks.
You killed Benny Hammond, you faked Will Byers' death.
You made it look like that little girl just ran away.
See, I told you.
- I know everything.
- All right, who are you working with? Nobody.
But I did give all this over to my friend at the Times.
He's gonna blow this thing wide open.
[chuckles] - [electricity crackling] - [groans] [grunting] You're just a junkie.
A small town cop who had a really bad week.
Took one too many pills this time.
You made a mistake coming back here.
No, I didn't.
Here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna let me and Joyce Byers go you're gonna give us anything we need, and we're gonna find her son.
And then we're gonna forget that any of this ever happened.
Oh, is that right? Yeah.
That's right.
Nancy? Jonathan? [door closes] - They're gone.
- What? Nancy and Jonathan.
His car's gone.
They're probably just sucking face somewhere.
- [Lucas] Gross.
- No.
No way! Did they go with the chief? I don't know.
No.
What? Did you see them? Do you know where they went? - Yes.
- Where? Where did they go? Demogorgon.
[sighs] Where's the girl? [inhales deeply] [exhales] You gotta give me your word.
Nobody's ever gonna find out about this.
And those other three kids, those boys, you're gonna leave them alone.
Then I'll tell you.
Tell you where your little science experiment is.
[sighs] [gasps] I don't understand.
We came to an agreement.
What? Look, everything that's happened here and everything that's gonna happen, we don't talk about.
You want Will back? This place had nothing to do with it.
That's the deal.
You got it? What is this? Protection.
The atmosphere is toxic.
[stutters] But my son's in there.
He Put it on.
[Connie] I'm telling you, this is a mistake.
[Dr.
Brenner] It's gone.
Isn't that what you wanted? And if they find the boy? That's not gonna happen.
[low growling] [theme music playing] [Joyce breathing heavily] [Hopper] Hey, you all right? [Joyce] Yeah.
[Hopper echoing] I need you to relax, okay? I want you to slow down your breathing, take deep breaths.
In and out.
Deep breath in and out.

One two You don't have to do this Jonathan, stop talking.
- I'm just saying, you don't have to - Three.
[Mike] Guys, guys! This is crazy.
We can't just wait around.
Mike, in case you forgot, we're still fugitives.
The bad men are still looking for us.
Yeah, and we don't even know where your sister is.
El can find them.
Mike, look at her.
I still think we should stick to the chief's plan.
Exactly.
We stay here, keep El out of sight and keep her safe.
That's the most important thing, remember? Besides, she's okay.
She's with Jonathan.
Yeah, and she's kind of a badass now, so Well, where are you going? You just said stick to the plan! I am.
I'm just gonna go get some chocolate pudding.
I'm telling you, Lunch Lady Phyllis hoards that shit.
[Mike] Are you serious? El needs to be recharged! [door opens] [door shuts] [faint creaking] Did you hear that? It's just the wind.
Don't worry.
My mom, she said the lights speak when it comes.
Speak? Blink.
Think of them as alarms.
Is that too tight? [stutters] No, it's fine.
Thanks.
Nancy? Yeah? - [banging on door] - [both gasp] [Steve] Jonathan? Are you there, man? It's it's Steve! Listen, I just want to talk! [banging on door continues] - Steve, listen to me.

[electricity jolts] Do you hear anything? No.
[door opening] [Joyce echoing] Will! Will! [breathing heavily] Will! Will! [indistinct sobbing] [Hopper] "I asked Mrs.
Spencer what made them red and she said she didn't know and for pity's sake not to ask her any more questions.
She said I must have asked her a thousand already.
I suppose I had, too, but how are you gonna find things out if you don't ask questions? And what does make roads red? 'Well, I don't know, ' said Matthew.
It just makes me feel glad to be alive it's such an interesting world.
" [sobbing] [Joyce yelling] Will! [Hopper] Will! [Steve muttering] This is crazy.
This is crazy.
This is crazy.
This is crazy! This is crazy! This is crazy! What are you do What are you doing? Are you insane? It's going to come back! So you need to leave.
Right now.
[electricity pulsating] [both breathing heavily] [Nancy] Where is it? [Jonathan] Come on.
Come on, you son of a bitch.
- You see it? - No.

[monster screeching] Did you hear that? [screeching continues faintly] Get back! [grunting] - [Jonathan panting] - [all coughing] [all panting] [Nancy] Where did it go? [Jonathan] No.
It has to be dead.
[panting] It has to be.
[Hopper] Come on.
[Joyce] Is that my house? [door creaking] [Jonathan gasps] [Jonathan sighs] [Hopper] It was hurt.
[Steve panting] Mom.
[Jonathan echoing] Is that you? Mom.
Jonathan? [Hopper] Joyce, come on.
[crackling] Where's it going? I don't think that's the monster.
Found it! I knew she was hoarding it.
- I knew it.
- Yeah.
Always lying, saying she's out.
Bald-faced liar.
Mike, I found the chocolate pudding! Okay! Are you feeling any better? [sighs] What's "putting"? [chuckles] Pudding, it's it's this chocolate goo you eat with a spoon.
Don't worry, when all this is over, you won't have to keep eating junk food and leftovers like a dog anymore.
My mom, she's a pretty awesome cook.
She can make you whatever you like.
Eggos? Well, yeah, Eggos, but real food, too.
[sighs] See, I was thinking, once all this is over and Will's back and you're not a secret anymore, my parents can get you an actual bed for the basement.
Or you can take my room if you want, since I'm down there all the time anyways.
My point is, they'll take care of you.
They'll be like your new parents, and Nancy, she'll be like your new sister.
Will you be like my brother? What? No, no.
[scoffs] Why "no"? Because [sighs] 'cause it's different.
Why? [sighs] I mean, I don't know, I guess it's not.
It's stupid.
Mike? Yeah? Friends don't lie.
[sighing] Well I was thinking I don't know maybe we can go to the Snow Ball together.
- "Snow Ball"? - It's this cheesy school dance, where you go in the gym and dance to music and stuff.
I've never been, but I know you're not supposed to go with your sister.
- No? - I mean you can, but it'd be really weird.
You go to school dances with someone that, you know someone that you like.
- A friend? - Not a friend.
[sighs] Uh uh Uh, someone like a [car approaching] Nancy.
Hold on, I'll be right back.
Stay here.
[tires screeching] - [tires screeching] - [indistinct yelling] [agent] Go! You two, on me.
This will charge your battery right up, I'm telling you.
- [Mike] Guys! Guys! - What is it? [panting] They found us.
[agent] We know they're here.
Be advised, west side of the building is clear.
[agent] Sir, we've searched everywhere.
There's no sign of them.
[indistinct radio chatter] [agent] Nothin'.
Keep it locked down.
[agent] All right.
Kitchen.
[indistinct radio chatter] [panting] How did they find us? I don't know, but they knew we were in the gym.
Lando.
[agent] Got 'em! [Mike] Go, go, go, go, go! [Lucas] Come on! [agents yelling indistinctly] - There they are.
Freeze.
- [Mike] Back! Go back! [Mike] Go, go! Go left! [indistinct yelling] - [squelching] - [choking] [Eleven thuds] [Mike panting] El, are you okay? El! - Something's wrong.
- She's just drained.
No, no, no, she won't wake up.
El! El! [echoing] El! [Hopper] There's more blood.
Oh, my God.
[Joyce] This way.
- She's barely breathing.
- We gotta go.
[Dr.
Brenner] Leave her.
- Step away from the child.
- [Mike] No! You want her, you have to kill us first.
- That's right! - Eat shit! - Oh, no! No, no! - No! No! Get off me! - [screaming] You idiot! - No! [Dustin] Get off me! [Mike] Ow! Let go! Eleven? Eleven, can you hear me? Eleven? Papa? Yes, yes, it's your papa.
- [Mike] Get off of me.
[grunts] - [Dr.
Brenner] I'm here now.
Let her go! Let her go, you bastard! [whimpering] Shh, shh, you're sick.
You're sick, but I'm going to make you better.
I'm going to take you back home, where I can make you well again.
Where we can make all of this better, so no one else gets hurt.
Bad.
Bad.
Mike.
Mike.
- [grunts] - Mike.
[electricity spiking] Blood.
What? Blood.
[thudding] [screeching] Demogorgon.
[Mike] Go, go, go, go, go! - [guns firing] - [indistinct shouting] [Mike] Come on, come on.
[Lucas] Go, go! [monster screeching] [indistinct shouting] [yells] [under breath] Oh, my God.
Will! Will! Will! Oh, my God! Will! Hopper! Oh, my God! You need to help get him out! [Joyce crying] Get him out! [Joyce whimpers] - [grunts] - [tendril hissing] Oh, Jesus.
- [guns firing] - Come on, come on! [Dustin] Oh, my God! [agents yelling indistinctly] Sorry.
Hold on, we're almost there.
We're almost there.
Come on.
[panting] Come on.
Help, help.
Come on, get her on the table.
[Eleven groans] [sighs] Just hold on a little longer, okay? [sniffles] He's gone.
The bad man's gone.
We'll be home soon, and my mom she'll get you your own bed.
You can eat as many Eggos as you want.
[sniffles] And we can go to the Snow Ball.
[softly] Promise? [sniffles] Promise.
- [monster screeching] - [screams] [gunfire] [thudding] [gunfire continues] [gunfire stops] [Dustin stutters] Is Is it dead? [Mike] Go, go, go, go! [Dustin] Get the wrist rocket! Get the wrist rocket now! - [Mike] Go, go, go, go, go! - [monster roaring] - Go, go, go.
- [Dustin] Take it out now! Get the rocks, get the rocks, get the rocks! Getting the rocks! - Give me one.
- [Dustin] Come on! - Go! Go! Kill it! Kill it! - Fire! Fire! [roaring] - Give me another one.
- Kill it! Bastard! [Mike] Kill it! Go, go, go, go! [Dustin] Kill it now! Get, get, get Come on, kill the bastard! It's not working! - Hit him again.
- Kill him! - [Mike] Keep going! Come on! - Get, get, get - Come on, kill it! - Come on! Go, go, go! [growling] [all panting] Eleven, stop! [screams] [monster squealing] [squealing continues] Goodbye, Mike.
[monster squealing] No more.
[screeching] [groaning] [yelling] El? El? - El! - [Lucas] Eleven! [Dustin] Eleven! [Mike] El! El, where are you? Eleven! El? [Joyce panting] Oh, God.
[sobbing] He's not breathing, he's not breathing.
All right, Joyce, Joyce, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.
- I need you to tilt his head back - Okay.
- and lift his chin.
- Okay.
One, two, three, four.
Now when I tell you, you're gonna pinch his nostrils, and breathe into his mouth - twice.
- Okay.
One second then pause.
22, 23.
- Then one second.
- Okay.
24, 25, 26, 27, 28 29, 30.
Now! Go! [Joyce whimpers] - [Joyce] Oh, come on, come on.
- Come on Come on, kid.
- Come on, kid! - Will! Will, listen to me.
It's me, it's your mom and I love you so much.
I love you so much.
I love you more than anything in the world.
[echoing] Please - [EKG monitor beeping] - [nurse] Blood pressure keeps dropping.
Her pulse ox is falling.
[Joyce sobbing] I love you so much.
I love you more than anything in the world.
[sobbing] Please, please come back to me.
Just - Come on, kid! - Please, please wake up.
Please, please.
[Joyce echoing] Breathe, Will, come on! - [EKG monitor flatlining] - [nurse] Flatlining! [sobbing] [Joyce echoing] Come back to me, breathe.
I need you to wake up now.
I need you to breathe.
Please breathe! Please! [Will gasps and coughs] [Joyce] That's it.
- Oh, my God, that's it, that's it.
- [coughing] That's it, baby.
Breathe.
Breathe.
All right.
Come on.
Come on.
Breathe, breathe, come on, come on.
Good, good, good, good.
Just breathe, Will, breathe.
[sobbing] Michael? Michael! Michael? [sobs] Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
You're okay.
You're okay.
[EKG monitor beeping] Hey.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- [Jonathan] Hey.
Where where am I? [Joyce sighs] [Jonathan] You're home.
You're home now.
You're safe.
Jonathan.
Yeah, it's me, buddy.
[sighs] We missed you.
We really missed you.
Are you okay? What, this? It's just a cut.
It's nothing.
You're worried about my hand.
[both chuckle softly] [Jonathan] Oh, hey, uh We, uh We brought you some stuff so you don't get bored in here.
So [sniffles] Uh, I made you a new mix tape.
There's some stuff on there I think you really might like.
[snoring] Guys.
Guys, he's up.
Will is up.
Guys, Will's up.
[Lucas and Dustin grunt] [Mike] Guys, come on.
- [Mike] Byers! - [Dustin laughs] [Joyce] Be careful.
Be careful with him.
[Dustin] Move.
[Jonathan] Guys, guys.
- [Mike laughs] - [Jonathan] Go easy on him.
You won't believe what happened when you were gone, man.
- It was mental.
- [Lucas] You had a funeral.
- Jennifer Hayes was crying.
- And Troy peed himself.
- What? - In front of the whole school! - [Lucas] Yes! - [coughing] You okay? It got me.
The Demogorgon.
We know.
It's okay.
It's dead.
We made a new friend.
She stopped it.
She saved us.
But she's gone now.
- Her name's Eleven.
- Like the number? Well, we call her "El" for short.
She's basically a wizard.
[whispers] She has superpowers.
More like a Yoda.
[Dustin] She flipped a van with her mind, and these agents were trying to shoot us - Yeah, it flipped over us - Then she squeezed the brains out [Dustin] And blood was pouring out of their faces.
[Mike] It was pouring out of their eyes.
[Lucas] Agents just started grabbing us and stuff - [Dustin] shot out of the wall - [continues indistinctly] [Mike] Something is coming.
Something angry.
Hungry for your blood.
It is almost here.
- What is it? - It's the thessalhydra, I'm telling you.
It's not the thessalhydra.
I'm telling you, it's the thessalhydra.
- [loud thud] - The thessalhydra! - Damn it.
- [Mike] It roars in anger! - Will, your action! - What should I do? I Fireball him! Fireball the son of a bitch.
- Fourteen! - [all exclaim] Direct hit.
Will the Wise's fireball hits the thessalhydra.
It makes a painful [imitates screeching] and then it crumbles to the ground.
Its clawed hand reaches for you one last time and, and, and and [all cheering] Lucas cuts off its seven heads, and Dustin places them into his bag of holding.
You carry the heads out of the dungeon, victorious, and you present them to King Tristan.
He thanks you for your bravery and service.
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not it, is it? No, there's a medal ceremony Oh, a medal ceremony? What are you talking about? - And - The campaign was way too short.
- Yeah! - It was ten hours! But it doesn't make any sense.
- It makes sense.
- Uh, no, what about the lost knight? And the proud princess? And those weird flowers in the cave? - I don't know, it's - [door opens] [footsteps approaching] Jeez, what's that smell? Have you guys been playing games all day, or just farting? [chuckles] Oh, that's just Dustin.
He farted.
- Dustin farted.
[blows raspberry] - [Dustin] Okay.
- [Lucas] Dustin farted.
- Very mature, Lucas.
- [Lucas blowing raspberry] - [Dustin] Oh.
- Will.
- [Dustin] Shut up.
[Jonathan] Come on.
[Lucas] Dustin farted! [Will] Bye, guys.
[Mike and Dustin] Bye, Will.
[Mike] See you, Will.
- [chuckles] Stop.
- No, you stop.
- [Dustin] No, you stop.
- [both grunting] [Dustin] Yeah, scream! You're like a little girl.
[boys laughing] - So, you have fun? - Yeah.
[Karen] Hey, boys.
- Hey, Mrs.
Wheeler.
- Hi.
Hey, wish your mom a merry Christmas for me, okay? - Yeah.
- Yeah, thank you.
Uh, merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
- So, uh, you win? - Yeah.
- Awesome.
- Hey, Jonathan, wait up.
- Uh - Merry Christmas.
Thanks, um I I didn't get you anything.
- I I feel bad.
- No.
No, it's, uh, it's not really a present.
It's, um Well, you'll see.
Merry Christmas.
- You ready? Let's go.
- [Will] Yeah.
[sighs] All right.
Buckle up.
Can I open it? Yeah, sure.
Whoa.
Pretty cool.
[chuckles] Yeah.
Yeah, pretty cool.
[chuckles softly] [snoring] Did you give it to him? Yeah.
[indistinct chatter] You leaving already, Chief? Oh, come on, you think I actually wanted to come to this thing? I was just hungry.
Oh, yeah, that's the spirit.
Well, your wife doesn't have time to cook for me, you know what I'm saying? [Powell chuckling] Merry Christmas, Hop.
- Mmm.
- [chuckles] [dog barking] - [Jonathan] What you got there? - [Christmas music playing] That one of yours? - Yeah.
- [Jonathan] Looks pretty big.
Be careful.
You'll break it.
What are you What are you doing? [Jonathan] Documenting.
Oh, why? - Because - [Joyce chuckles] - It looks great.
- Oh, this is just so overcooked.
- And look, the potatoes are runny.
- Mom.
- They're so runny.
- [chuckles] Mom, it's gonna be great.
- It's definitely an Atari.
- An a-what-i? The green present.
It's an Atari.
I felt Dustin's today, it's the same exact weight.
- Really? Well - [Will] Yeah.
We'll have to see, won't we? Hey, no more snooping.
No, I forgot to wash my hands.
I'll be right back.
Okay.
- [softly] He's washing his hands? - [chuckles] [coughs] [retches] [groans] - [Jonathan] Thanks.
- [both laughing] Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay.
[Jonathan] Mmm.
Very good, Mom.
Mmm.
Hey, Mom.
Did Will tell you about, uh, the game? - Oh, yeah.
- No.
What game? I threw a fireball at him and [imitates explosion] dead.
Wait, what is You mean, this is No, it's just Dungeons & Dragons.
- Dungeons & Dragons.
Right.

Lucas, you copy? I've got four quarters.
What's your haul? Take your puny haul and multiply it by five.
- How? - While you were scrounging around like a homeless bum, I mowed Old Man Humphrey's lawn.
Old Man Humphrey's got that kinda cash? - Just call Mike already.
- You call Mike.
I have to go take a shower from doing real work, like a man.
Over and out.
[DUSTIN OVER WALKIE-TALKIE] Mike, do you copy? Mike, do you copy? Yeah.
Yeah, I copy.
- What are you doing on this channel? - Nothing.
Lucas and I have six bucks total.

Call Will.
What the hell are you doing? I'll pay you back! - [MIKE] Bye! - [NANCY] Mike! - Mike! Get back here! - Hey.
No running in the house.
What is going on? [NANCY] Mike! Mike! Asshole! - Hey! - Okay.
So, I'll pick you up in two hours.
- That's 9:00 on the dot, okay? - Okay.
If anything happens, if you need to come home, just ask them to use their phone and call home.
Okay? - Don't - Don't walk or bike home.
I know.
- Okay, but, sweetie - Mom, I have to go.
Have fun.
To slay the dragon, use the magic sword.
[DUSTIN] Oh, Jesus! I'm in unchartered territory here, guys.
- Down! Down! Down! - [DUSTIN] I'm going! I'm going! [EXCLAIMS] I'm going! I'm going! I'm going! - [ALL CLAMORING] - Okay.

No.
No! No! No! No! I hate this overpriced bullshit! Son of a bitch! Piece of shit! You're not nimble enough.
But you'll get there one day.
But until then, Princess Daphne is still mine.
Whatever.
I'm still tops on Centipede and Dig Dug.
[KEITH] You sure about that? Sure about what? You're kidding me.
No, no, no.
Move! Move! No, no, no, no, no.
Hey, no! No! No! [VIDEO GAME CHIMES] - 751,300 points! - [MIKE] That's impossible.
- Who is Mad Max? - Better than you.
- Is it you? - [SCOFFS] You know I despise Dig Dug.
- Then who is it? - Yeah, spill it, Keith.
You want information, then I need something in return.
No, no, no.
No way.
You're not getting a date with her.
Mike, come on.
Just get him the date.
I'm not prostituting my sister! - But it's for a good cause.
- No, don't get him the date.
Know what? He's gonna spread his nasty-ass rash to your whole family.
Acne isn't a rash and it isn't contagious, you prepubescent wastoid.
Oh, I'm a wastoid? She wouldn't go on a date with you.
You make, like, what? $2.
50 an hour? - [KEITH] Nice perm.
- Gonna make fun of my hair? [RUMBLING] Hey.
Hey, guys, do you see the - [CRASHING] - [GASPS] - [THUNDER CRASHING] - [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] - Will! Are you okay? - [GASPS] Yeah.
I just - I needed some air.
- Come on.
You're up on Dig Dug.
Let's take that top score back, huh? [MURRAY] Good morning, Jim.
- Jim.
Hold on a second.
We need to talk.
- Get away from me.
Okay, no I think you really wanna hear this.
- Get away from me.
- Trust me.
I only want five minutes! Yeah, I want a date with Bo Derek.
We all want things.
This isn't a laughing matter, Jim.
- This is serious, okay? - [GROANS] I really got something here.
I'm telling you! - Hey.
Mornin', Chief.
- Morning.
Morning, Murray.
Got any proof on your butt-probin' aliens yet, Murray? - [POWELL LAUGHS] - I believe there was, and may still be, a Russian spy presence in Hawkins.
Russian spies! Are the spies in cahoots with the aliens? Or how do they fit in here? I'm confused.
I'm talking multiple reports now.
Multiple reports, okay? Of a Russian child in Hawkins.
- A child? What are you talking about? - A girl who may have psionic abilities.
- "Psionic"? - Psychic.
What about that girl that made that kid pee himself? - A prank.
- What girl? - Wasn't a prank.
- [HOPPER MOCKS] You got five minutes.
Not a second more.
[MURRAY] I talked to a Big Buy ex-employee who said some little girl shattered the door with her mind.
I heard that story.
Did you hear the one about the fat man with the beard who climbs down chimneys? [MURRAY] Then last month, a co-worker of Ted Wheeler's claims some Russian girl with a shaved head was hiding in his basement.
Ted now denies this.
- Oh, wow.
That's a surprise.
- But it connects.
- Enlighten me.
- This girl, she's some kind of a Russian weapon, right? Barbara sees this girl, tries to help her, perhaps.
But before she can, the Russians find them, take them Wait.
You're telling me Barbara Holland was kidnapped by Russian spies.
- Kidnapped.
Killed.
- Killed? - Don't you get it, Jim? - No.
This has potentially international implications.
I'm talking a full-on Russian invasion right here in Hawkins.
[WHIRRING] Do you have any proof of this girl? I mean, has anybody seen her recently? - These are separate - [PHONE RINGS] Excuse me.
Sorry.
- Okay.
- Hello? Merrill called, wants you to check out his pumpkins.
- Says they've been contaminated - All right.
By his vengeful neighbor, Eugene.
You're welcome.
I'm sorry.
I really hate to do this, but I gotta run.
- It's an emergency.
- You gave me five minutes.
Yeah, listen, you know what? I liked your alien theory a lot better.
And you want my advice? Why don't you stop bleeding those people dry and go home? All right? - I am not bleeding anyone dry.
- Listen to me.
Go home.
It's crap, I know.
No, it's not crap.
- It's not good.
- It's going to be.
- Just It needs some reorganizing.
- [SIGHS] - Can I mark on it? - Yeah, I guess.
So, in the first paragraph, you used the basketball game versus Northern as a metaphor for your life, which is great.
But then, around here, you start talking about your granddad's experiences in the war.
And I [STAMMERS] I don't see how they're connected.
It connects because because, you know, we both won.
- Do you think I should start from scratch? - No.
I mean When's the deadline? It's tomorrow for early application.
Can you come and help me tonight? We have our dinner tonight, remember? - Oh, my God! - We already canceled last week.
- You don't have to go.
Just work on this.
- No, no, no.
What's the point? - Hey, calm down.
- I'm calm.
I'm calm.
I'm just being honest.
You know, I mean - I'll end up working for my dad anyway.
- That's not true.
I don't know, Nance.
Is that such a bad thing? There's insurance and benefits and all that adult stuff.
And if I took it, you know, I could be around for your senior year.
- Steve - Just to look after you a little bit.
Make sure you don't forget about this pretty face.
[CHUCKLES] Nance, I'm serious.
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
[CAR ENGINE REVVING] [TIRES SCREECHING] Who is that? I have no idea.
But would you check out that ass? Just look at it go.
[GIGGLES] [BELL RINGING] Meet the human brain.
I know.
I know, it doesn't look like much.
A little gross even, right? But consider this.
There are a hundred billion cells inside of this miracle of evolution.
All working as one.
No, no, I did not misspeak.
I did not stutter.
A hundred billion.
- [DOOR CLOSES] - Ah, this must be our new student.
[PRINCIPAL] Indeed.
All yours.
All right.
Hold up.
You don't get away that easy.
Come on up.
Don't be shy.
Dustin, drum roll.
Class, please welcome, all the way from sunny California, the latest passenger to join us on our curiosity voyage, Maxine.
- It's Max.
- [MR.
CLARKE] Sorry? Nobody calls me Maxine.
It's Max.
- [WHISPERS] Mad Max.
- Well, all aboard, Max.
- Hey, there.
- Hey.
Do you have these in any other colors? I'm not a big fan of orange.
Hmm I'll have to check in back.
Oh, shit! - You're gonna get me fired.
- That's my master plan.
Get you fired so I can hire you and we won't have to hide back here.
Bob? Bob, I have to get back to work.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I can't stop thinking about you.
- It's crazy.
I feel like a teenager.
- Me, too.
You know, in high school, you didn't know who I was.
Come on.
[CHUCKLES] Bob, I have to get back to work.
Okay.
Go sell your electronic thingamajiggies, and I'll see you tonight for movie night.
Jonathan's night to pick? - Yes.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Okay.
Hey, look, a green one.
Tell Jonathan not to pick anything scary.
I hate scary movies.
[HOPPER] You're saying this was fine yesterday? [MERRILL] Fine? These were prize winners, Chief.
You should've seen 'em.
For the life of me, I couldn't figure out what happened.
And then I remembered Eugene.
What about him? He's been complaining about me to just about anyone who'll listen.
Why's that? Well, he started this "Pick Your Pumpkin" thing.
Acted like it was trademarked.
I said, "Hire yourself a damn lawyer.
See how far that gets you.
" You're telling me that nice old Eugene came out here after dark and doused your field with poison? Not Eugene himself.
- I'm thinking one of his field hands.
- Uh-huh.
Listen, Chief, I don't go throwing around accusations lightly.
You know me.
This happening the day before Halloween, when sales are peaking? That's a hell of a coincidence.
- Hell of a coincidence.
- [FLIES BUZZING] You got somebody working on that field? [RUSTLING] [RUSTLING CONTINUES] - [SCREECHING] - [YELLS] - [PANTING] - [CAWS] Yeah, screw you, too.
[TINA] Hey.
Be there.
- Hey, Nancy.
- Hey! Thanks.
- Oh, could I get one more? - Yeah, sure.
You're coming to this.
"Come and get sheet faced.
" No, I'm not.
I can't let you sit all alone Halloween.
That's just not acceptable.
Well, you can relax.
I'm not gonna be alone.
I'm going trick-or-treating with Will.
- All night? - Yeah.
No, no way.
You're gonna be home by 8:00, listening to the Talking Heads and reading Vonnegut or something.
Sounds like a nice night.
Jonathan, just come.
I mean, who knows, you might even, like, meet someone.
- [SHRIEKS] - [CHUCKLES] - Oh, my God! Take those stupid things off.
- I missed you.
- It's been like an hour.
- Tell me about it.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
God.
[STEVE] Sorry.
- [MIKE] There's no way that's Mad Max.
- Yeah.
Girls don't play video games.
And even if they did, you can't get 750,000 points on Dig Dug.
- It's impossible.
- [LUCAS] But her name is Max.
- So what? - So, how many Maxes do you know? - I don't know.
- [LUCAS] Zero.
That's how many.
She shows up at school the day after someone with her same name breaks our top score.
- I mean, you kidding me? - Exactly.
So she's gotta be Mad Max.
And plus she skateboards, so she's pretty awesome.
Awesome? You haven't even spoken a word to her.
I don't have to.
I mean, look at her.
Shit, I've lost the target.
Oh! There.
Got it.
There we go.
[ALL] "Stop spying on me, creeps.
" Well, shit.
[PRINCIPAL] William Byers.
Your mother's here.
[DUSTIN] You guys think he's okay? [LUCAS] He's always weird when he has to go in.
I don't know.
He's quiet today.
He's always quiet.
You feeling any better? Will? Huh? [MUMBLES] Yeah.
Yeah, sorry.
Hey.
What did we talk about, huh? You've got to stop it with the sorries.
Sorry.
I mean, yeah, I know.
And listen, you know, there's nothing to be nervous about, you know.
Just tell 'em what you felt last night and what you saw.
Hey, I'm gonna be there the whole time.
So it's gonna be okay.
Okay? Okay.
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.
Hey.
[CLATTERS] [WHIRRING] Sir Will, how are you? Mom.
Pop.
Let's take a look, see what's going on here.
I see you shaved off a pound since we saw you last.
Must be making room for all that Halloween candy.
What's your favorite candy? Desert island candy, if you had to pick one? - I don't know.
- Come on.
Life or death situation, what would you pick? - I guess Reese's Pieces.
- [MOUTHING] Reese's Pieces.
Good call.
Good call.
I'm more of a Mounds guy, but I gotta say, peanut butter and chocolate, come on, hard to beat that.
All right, tell me what's going on with you.
Tell me about this episode you had.
[WILL] Well, my friends were there and then they just weren't, and I was back there again.
In the Upside Down? All right, so what happened next? I heard this noise, and so I went outside, and it was worse.
How was it worse? There was this storm.
[THUNDER CRASHING] Okay.
So how did you feel when you saw the storm? I felt frozen.
- Heart racing? - Just frozen.
Frozen, cold frozen? Frozen to the touch? No.
Like how you feel when you're scared, and you can't breathe or talk or do anything.
I felt felt this evil, like it was looking at me.
It was evil? Well [CLEARS THROAT] What do you think the evil wanted? To kill.
[WHIRRING RAPIDLY] To kill you? Not me.
Everyone else.
[OWENS] All right, I'm gonna be honest with you.
It's probably gonna get worse before it gets better.
Worse? He's already had two episodes this month.
He'll likely have more before the month is out.
It's called the Anniversary Effect.
And we've seen this with soldiers.
The anniversary of an event brings back traumatic memories.
Sort of opens up the neurological floodgates, so to speak.
So what does this mean for the kid? He's gonna have more episodes, nightmares? Yeah, that.
Maybe some personality changes.
He might get irritable.
He might lash out.
What do we do when that happens? Okay.
Well, from what we know about post-traumatic stress And we're still learning, okay? Just treat him normally.
Be patient with him.
Don't pressure him to talk.
Just let him lead the way.
I'm sorry, what you're saying is it's gonna get worse and worse and we're just supposed to pretend it's not happening? It sounds counterintuitive, I know.
But I assure you that is really the best thing you can do for him.
Listen.
I understand what you went through last year.
I get it.
But those people are gone.
They're gone.
Okay? So if we're gonna get through this, I just I need you to realize I'm on your side.
I need you to trust me.
[JOYCE] "Trust me"? - Are you kidding me? - [HOPPER] Yeah, I know.
But, you know, university gives out a degree, this guy's got it.
And look, that post-traumatic stuff he's talking about, that stuff is real.
He's gonna be okay.
All right? How's Bob the Brain? Don't call him that.
Sorry.
Old habit.
He's good.
We're good.
Good.
I'm happy for you.
Really.
Hey Things get worse, you call me first.
You call me.
Okay.
They're ready for you, sir.
- Patty.
- Sam.
Afternoon, sir.
- Looks like another hot one today, huh? - Never gets old, sir.
[SCREECHING] [DUSTIN] Still no sign? [LUCAS] Jack shit.
Oh! Damn it.
My mom's gonna murder me.
So go home.
I'll radio if she comes.
Oh, yeah, nice try.
You just want me out of here so you can make your move.
- Oh, 'cause you're such a threat.
- That's right.
She will not be able to resist these pearls.
[PURRS] - Ten o'clock.
Ten o'clock.
- What? [INDISTINCT ARGUING] - They're arguing.
They're arguing.
- Oh, my God.
I see that.
I don't even know why you need those.
God.
You're so stupid.
[VIDEO GAME CHIMING] She's incredible.
She's [BOTH] Mad Max.
After dinner, I want you to pick out your toys for the yard sale.
- Fine.
- Two boxes' worth.
- Two boxes? - You heard me.
I'm fine with you giving away a couple, but the other ones have way too much emotional value.
- Emotional value? - They're hunks of plastic, Michael.
You already took away my Atari.
Didn't wanna lose more toys, you shouldn't have stolen from Nancy.
I didn't steal.
I borrowed.
Oh, and you didn't curse out Mr.
Kowalski last week either, right? Or plagiarize that essay? Or graffiti the bathroom stall? Everyone graffitis the bathroom stall.
So if your friend jumps off a cliff, you're gonna jump, too? We know you've had a hard year, Michael.
But we've been patient.
This isn't strike one.
This isn't even strike three.
It's strike 20.
You're on the bench, son.
And if it'd been my coach, you'd be lucky to still be on the team.
Two boxes.
Two.
[STEVE] Okay.
Ready? Yeah.
[SIGHS] Okay.
[DOORBELL RINGS] [MARSHA] I'm so sorry I didn't get to cook.
I was gonna make that baked ziti you guys like so much, but I just forgot about the time, and before you know it, "Oh, my God, it's five o'clock.
" - It's fine.
It's great.
- Right.
I love KFC.
So, I noticed a "For Sale" sign out in your yard.
Is that the neighbors', or - You wanna tell them? - Go ahead.
We hired a man named Murray Bauman.
Have either of you heard of him? - No.
- No, I don't think so.
He was an investigative journalist for the Chicago Sun-Times.
He's pretty well known.
Anyway, he's freelance now, and he agreed to take the case.
That's That's great.
No, that's really That's great, right? Um, what exactly does that mean? Means he's gonna do what that lazy son of a bitch Jim Hop Sorry.
[EXHALES] What the Hawkins police haven't been capable of doing.
Means we have a real detective on the case.
It means we're going to find our Barb.
If anyone can find her, it's this man.
He already has leads.
By God, he's worth every last penny.
Is that why you're selling the house? Don't worry about us, sweetie.
We're fine.
More than fine.
For the first time in a long time, we're hopeful.
[STAMMERS] Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
- It's finger-lickin' good.
- Mmm.
[BREATHING HEAVILY] [CRYING] [TOY SCREECHES] El, are you there? El? [STATIC CRACKLING] It's me.
It's Mike.
It's day 352, 7:40 p.
m.
I'm still here.
If you're out there, say something.
Or give me a sign.
I won't even say anything.
Just I wanna know if you're okay.
[STATIC CRACKLING] I'm so stupid.
[DISTORTED VOICE] Mike.
- [DUSTIN OVER WALKIE-TALKIE] Mike? - Hello, is that you? Yeah, it's me, Dustin.
What're you doing on this channel again? I've been trying to reach you all day.
We were right.
Max is Mad Max.
- Yeah, I'm busy.
- But - [LUCAS] What do we do now? - We stick to the plan.
Mike's not gonna like it.
Last time I checked, our party is not a dictatorship.
- It's a democracy.
- What if Max says no? How can Max say no to these? [PURRS] I told you to stop that.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Later.
[CHIRPING] Mews! Mews.
[CRASHING] - Stop.
Stop! - [BOB] What? Come on, you gotta get used to it.
This is the future.
Well, put the future down and get me a clean bowl.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR] Hey, bud.
I didn't know what you'd like, so I got a variety.
- Take your pick.
- Whatever you want.
All right.
What are you working on? Zombie Boy? Who's Zombie Boy? - Me.
- Did someone call you that? Hey.
You can talk to me.
You know that, right? Whatever happened.
Will, come on, talk to me.
- Stop treating me like that.
- What? Like what? Like everyone else.
Like there's something wrong with me.
What are you talking about? Mom, Dustin, Lucas.
Everyone.
They all treat me like I'm gonna break.
Like I'm a baby.
Like I can't handle things on my own.
It doesn't help.
It just makes me feel like more of a freak.
- You're not a freak.
- Yeah, I am.
I am.
You know what? You're right.
You are a freak.
- What? - No, I'm serious.
You're a freak.
But what? Do you wanna be normal? Do you wanna be just like everyone else? Being a freak is the best.
I'm a freak.
Is that why you don't have any friends? [CHUCKLES] I have friends, Will.
Then why are you always hanging out with me? Because you're my best friend, all right? And I would rather be best friends with Zombie Boy than with a boring nobody.
You know what I mean? Okay, look Who would you rather be friends with? Bowie or Kenny Rogers? Ugh.
Exactly.
It's no contest.
The thing is, nobody normal ever accomplished anything meaningful in this world.
- You got it? - Well - some people like Kenny Rogers.
- Kenny Rogers.
I love Kenny Rogers.
[CHUCKLES] - What's so funny? - Nothing.
Mr.
Mom.
[WHOOPS] Perfect! [BOTH CHUCKLE] Where's Mommy keep the extra diapers? [BOB AND JOYCE LAUGH] [JACK] Hey! Cowards.
[BOTH LAUGH] [PHONE RINGING] Hey.
- It's okay.
Let it go.
- [PHONE CONTINUES RINGING] Probably just a crank call.
- Okay.
- [JACK] Holy mackerel! - Let it go.
- [JACK] Aw, man! [BOB LAUGHS] [PHONE CONTINUES RINGING] [THUDDING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [MACHINE BEEPING] [ALARM BLARING] [URINATING] [RUMBLING IN DISTANCE] [RUMBLING INTENSIFIES] [THUNDER CRASHING] [DOOR CREAKING] [BREATHING SHAKILY] [LIGHTNING CRACKLING] [RHYTHMIC KNOCKING] [DOOR UNLOCKS] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION OVER TV] Hey, what'd we talk about? [ELEVEN] No signal.
- What? - [ELEVEN] No signal.
It's 8-1-5.
You're late.
Yeah, I lost track of time.
I'll signal next time, all right? Uh, and it's 8:15.
It's not 8-1-5.
Eight-fifteen.
Now, what did we talk about? Dinner first, then dessert.
Always.
That's a rule.
Yeah? Yes.

1 [ELEVEN ECHOING] Goodbye, Mike.
[YELLING] [SCREECHING] [COUGHS] [GROANS] Mike? Mike? [BREATHING HEAVILY] Mike? Mike! [SCREAMING] Mike! Mike! [WHIMPERS] [SOLDIERS SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] [MUFFLED EXPLOSION] [SOLDIER 1] Bravo team, check in.
[ELEVEN BREATHING HEAVILY] [SOLDIERS CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY] [GRUNTS] [PANTING] [KAREN] What about the Russians? What if they come looking for her? They don't know where she is.
And she can't contact you without us knowing.
[MAN] The most important thing is for you to try to go on with your lives - and to keep all of this - Top secret.
Yeah.
Understood.
We're all patriots in this house.
- [WOMAN] Go back to the beginning.
- [MIKE] I told you everything.
- I understand this is difficult, Michael.
- I don't know where she is.
And even if I did, I'd never tell you.
I would never tell you.
[WOMAN] I know it's difficult to accept, the stories she told you were not true.
She's a very dangerous individual.
[MAN] If she contacts you, you must tell us.
[WOMAN] Otherwise, you're putting yourself and your entire family at risk.
Do you understand, Michael? Do you understand? [MAN] Michael? Michael? [MAN] Fan out.
Somebody check the left side, I'll check the right side.
[HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [HOPPER] Oh, Jesus! [ELEVEN] Ghost.
Yeah, I see that.
- [ELEVEN] Halloween.
- Sure is.
But right now, it's breakfast, okay? Come on, let's eat.
They wouldn't see me.
- Who wouldnât see you? - The bad men.
What are you talking about? Trick or treat.
You want to go trick-or-treating? You know the rules.
- Yes, but - Yeah, so you know the answer.
- No, but they wouldn't see me.
- No.
Hey.
I don't care.
- But they wouldnât see me.
- I don't care, all right? You go out there, ghost or not, it's a risk.
We don't take risks.
All right? They're stupid, and We're not stupid! Exactly.
Now, you take that off, sit down and eat.
Your food's getting cold.
[SIGHS] All right, look How about I get off early tonight, and I buy us a bunch of candy, and we can sit around and get fat, and we watch a scary movie together? How's that for a compromise? [STUTTERS] "Compromise"? C-O-M-promise.
Compromise.
How about that's your word for the day? Yeah? It's something that's kinda in-between.
It's like halfway happy.
By 5-1-5? 5:15.
Yeah, sure.
Promise? Yes.
I promise.
Halfway happy.
[CHUCKLES] Will? Come on, honey, up and at 'em.
Will? - Jonathan? - Yeah? Where's Will? - What? - Where's Will? - He's not in his room? - No.
Uh Will? What are you doing? Peeing? [CHUCKLES] Okay.
[TOILET FLUSHES] Okay.
- Let's get this on.
- [GRUNTS] Oh! You need some tape.
Hold on.
What's this? Nothing.
Did you have another episode? No, it's just, um a sketch for a story I'm writing.
[JOYCE SIGHS] All right.
[JONATHAN] Three, two, one - ["GHOSTBUSTERS" PLAYING] - Great.
Hold up the proton blaster.
All right, now turn to the light.
Oh! I want to see those pearls.
Yeah! - [MEOWS] - Who you gonna call? [SCATTING] [LAUGHS] Oh! Adorable, baby.
Just adorable! - God.
You are such a nerd.
- Shut up.
No wonder you only hang out with boys.
- Erica! - Just the facts.
[MOUTHING] Nerd.
[MRS.
SINCLAIR] My God, I love this costume.
Keep it up.
[MIKE] All right, that's the last one.
No, just one more.
Come on, please? Ah! - Can I go to school? - Wait, wait.
- Okay, say, "Who you gonna call?" - No! [ALL SINGING "GHOSTBUSTERS"] - Who you gonna call? - Ghostbusters! Hey, Spengler! - Egon! Yeah! - Venkman! Whoa! Whoa! - What? - Why are you Venkman? - Because I'm Venkman.
- No, I'm Venkman.
Why can't there be two Venkmans? Because there's only one Venkman in real life.
We planned this months ago.
I'm Venkman, Dustin's Stantz, you're Egon, and you're Winston.
- I specifically didn't agree to Winston.
- Yes, you did! - I don't think he did.
- No one wants to be Winston, man.
What's wrong with Winston? What's wrong with Winston? He joined the team super late, he's not funny, and he's not even a scientist! - Yeah, but he's still cool.
- If he's cool, then you be Winston.
- I can't! - Why not? - [STUTTERS] Because - [MOCKING MIKE] Because you're not black? - I didn't say that! - You thought it.
- I didn't say that! - Mike! Guys Guys! Guys! Why is no one else wearing costumes? [SCHOOL BELL RINGING] Crap.
- [STUDENTS LAUGHING] - [STUDENT] Oh, my God! When do people make these decisions? [WILL] Everyone dressed up last year.
- It's a conspiracy, I'm telling you.
- Just be cool.
[BOY] Who you gonna call? The nerds! - We gonna do this? - Not right now.
We look like morons.
[DUSTIN] Maybe she likes Ghostbusters? Of course she likes Ghostbusters, but that's not the point.
The point is we're dressed up and she isn't.
[DUSTIN] I didn't bring regular clothes.
You? [LUCAS] No.
Then we have no choice.
We gotta do this.
It's now or never.
- Right.
[SNIFFS] - Let's engage.
We could ask her after class.
- Yup.
- Okay.
[JOYCE] See? It's an exact match.
- But why would he lie to me? - [INHALES DEEPLY] He's a kid, Joyce.
I mean, you heard him describe these episodes.
It's not like he's describing a nightmare.
He talks about them like they're real.
Yeah, because they're not nightmares, they're flashbacks.
I know a couple guys who have had these things, and it feels like you're there, like it's happening.
- Then what the hell is this? - Owens said it would get worse.
- That place - What do you wanna do? You wanna take him back to Chicago? Well, there's that guy in Boston that's supposed to be They're all a bunch of quacks.
They'll all tell you the same thing, just cost you more money.
I think he's right about trauma.
And we're coming up on a year, you know.
I think everybody's on edge.
Me, you Will most of all.
I think we just gotta get through the next few weeks.
[SIGHS] [SIGHS] Nothing's gonna go back to the way that it was.
Not really.
But it'll get better.
In time.
[SIGHS HEAVILY] [JOYCE MUMBLES] - Here.
- Thank you.
- [CHOKES AND COUGHS] - [CHUCKLES] Jesus! Hopper Brings me back to old times.
What? - [SIGHS] Sharing my cigarettes between - Fifth and sixth period.
Yeah, under the steps.
Mr.
Cooper caught us that time, remember? He was like, [GRUFFLY] "Hey, assholes.
" We ran.
We just ran.
[CHUCKLES] God, I want this to be over.
I know.
[JOYCE SNIFFLES] [BEEPS] [STATIC CRACKLING] How's it looking out there, cowboy? [MAN] Uh, you know, Doc.
The usual.
Nice and nasty with a chance of radioactivity.
Oh, yeah, it's barbecued all right.
Anyone hungry? [TECHNICIAN] And [BEEPING] we're back on! [CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] [WILL] There was this storm.
[OWENS] Okay.
So how did you feel when you saw the storm? [WILL] I felt frozen.
[OWENS] Actually frozen? Cold? [WILL] No, like how you feel when you're scared, and you can't breathe or talk or do anything.
I felt I felt this evil [BARBARA ECHOING] Nancy, this isn't you.
[NANCY] Barb, just go ahead and go home, okay? [BARBARA] Nancy? Nancy! Nancy.
What's going on? Are you okay? - I can't keep doing this.
- Doing what? - Pretending like everything's okay.
- What are you talking about? Barbara.
It's like everyone forgot.
It's like nobody cares.
Except her parents.
- And now they're selling their house.
- Nance And they're going to spend the rest of their lives looking for her.
- I know.
- It's destroying them.
I know.
Okay? I get it.
But listen, there's nothing we can do about it.
Yeah, we could tell them the truth.
Well, you know that we can't do that.
We don't have to tell them everything.
This isn't some game, Nance.
If they found out that we told any They could put us in jail.
Okay? Or worse, they could destroy our families.
They could do anything they want.
Okay? Just think about what you're saying.
Hey Hey, hey Hey, it's [SIGHS] It's hard, but let's let's just go to Tina's stupid party wear our stupid costumes that we've been working on for a stupid amount of time, and just pretend like we're stupid teenagers, okay? Can we just do that, just for tonight? Okay.
Come here.
[NANCY SIGHS] [RINGING] [DUSTIN CLEARS THROAT] Um Hi, Max.
I'm Dustin, and this is - Lucas.
- Yeah, I know.
The stalkers.
[STUTTERS] Uh, no.
Actually We weren't stalking you.
No, we were just concerned because, you know, you're new and all.
Yeah, for your safety.
Mmm-hmm.
There are a lot of bullies here.
- [STUTTERING] So many bullies, it's crazy.
- Yeah.
Is that why you're wearing proton packs? Well, these don't function.
But I do have this handy-dandy little trap here.
And look, it even opens and closes.
Look, look, look VoilÃ ! [CHUCKLES] It's cool, right? No? Okay.
But, um So, we were talking last night, and you're new here, so you probably don't have any friends to take you trick-or-treating, and you're scared of bullies, so we were thinking that it would be okay if you come with us.
- "It'd be okay"? - Yeah.
Our party's a democracy, the majority voted you could come.
Didn't realize it was such an honor to go trick-or-treating with you.
We know where to get the full-sized candy bars.
We figured you'd want in.
That's presumptuous of you.
Yeah.
Totally.
Uh, so, um you'll come? We're meeting at the Maple Street cul-de-sac at 7:00.
That's 7:00 on the dot! "Presumptuous.
" That's a good thing, right? [SIGHS] Is it bad? Lucas, is it bad? Lucas? Son of a bitch, Lucas.
Is it bad? [WOMAN ON TV] How does it feel? Like pouring pure silk onto my skin.
[MAN] Inhuman.
Relentless.
Arnold Schwarzenegger is The Term Well, I'm stunned.
I don't know what to think.
- [MAN] Don't you love me? - [ERICA] Of course I love you.
It's just that it's so sudden.
I mean, it's not like you.
Erica, I am this way because of you.
- [ERICA] Me? - "Me?" [MAN] Mmm-hmm.
You have made me wild and impetuous, - just like you.
- "Impetuous.
" People are going to be aghast.
- "People are going to be aghast.
" - [MAN LAUGHS] They're gonna love it.
[BOTH LAUGHING ON TV] I mean, it's gonna stun the whole town.
The whole world! Erica, tell me that you will marry me, in this house, tonight [TELEVISION CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] [CHITTERING] [CHITTERING] [TWIG SNAPS] Hey.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
What's your name? What're you doing out here in the cold? [GRUNTS] [TIRES SCREECHING] [FLIES BUZZING] So, you're telling me that Merrill poisoned your farm, because he thinks you poisoned his, which, of course, you didn't? No, sir.
And I got me an alibi the night he accuses me.
My Jenny and her boys were in town.
I was with them all night.
- Did you actually see Merrill? - No need.
That man done lost his mind.
Went around slandering me, threatening all sorts of madness.
- A pumpkin conspiracy.
- [CHUCKLES] Hawkins' very own Chinatown.
Merrill threatening to do something and him actually doing something are two very different things.
- You got a better explanation? - Cold weather.
- It's October.
- Yeah, it's a cold one.
- You see these hands? - Yeah.
- You know why they look like that? - Because you're old? - You're damn straight.
- [POWELL CHUCKLES] And I've been doing this a long time, Chief.
A long time.
And I ain't never seen anything the likes of this.
- None of us have.
- None of us? Merrill didn't just hit me last night.
He hit damn near everyone.
What are you talking about? Jack O'Dell, Pete Freeling, Rick Neary, the Christensens.
All of their crops, dead.
Give me those names again.
You're late again.
- Yeah, I had to get catch-up homework.
- Jesus.
I don't care.
You're late again, and you're skating home.
Do you hear me? ["WANGO TANGO" BY TED NUGENT PLAYING] - [SONG CONTINUES ON CAR RADIO] - God, this place is such a shithole.
- It's not that bad.
- No? [BILLY INHALES DEEPLY] Mmm! You smell that, Max? That's actually shit.
- Cow shit.
- I don't see any cows.
Clearly, you haven't met the high-school girls.
- [SCOFFS] So what, you like it here now? - No.
- Then why are you defending it? - I'm not.
Sure sounds like it.
- It's just we're stuck here, so - Hmm.
You're right.
We're stuck here.
And whose fault is that? Yours.
- What'd you say? - Nothing.
- Did you say it's my fault? - No.
You know whose fault it is.
Say it.
Max say it.
Say it! ["WANGO TANGO" CONTINUES PLAYING] Really, everyone dressed up last year.
Billy, slow down.
- Oh, these your new hick friends? - No! I don't know them.
I guess you won't care if I hit 'em, then? I get bonus points, I get 'em all in one go? No, Billy, stop.
It's not funny.
[REVVING] Hey, guys? Billy, come on, stop it.
It's not funny.
Stop! - Go! - Mike, you need to haul ass! - Billy, stop it! - [TIRES SCREECHES] [DUSTIN] Whoa! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Yeah! That was a close one, huh? [BILLY LAUGHS] [DUSTIN] Holy shit! Was that Mad Max.
["WANGO TANGO" CONTINUES PLAYING] [WIND CHIMES RATTLING] [FLIES BUZZING] Now, you tryin' to tell me, with a straight face, cold did this? How far does it go? [POWELL OVER RADIO] Hey, Chief, you copy? [HOPPER] Uh Hey, Chief.
[HOPPER] How's it looking over there? Like a giant pissed all over Jack's bean field.
Smells, too.
It smell over there? Uh, yeah, little bit.
[GRUNTS] Smells like a nursing home, man.
Listen.
I want you guys to track the rot, see how far it goes.
Just, uh, mark anything that's dead.
- That's gonna take some time.
- So take it.
And, look, we don't know what caused this.
Could be poison.
So don't touch anything without gloves.
[SNIFFS] Copy that, Chief.
[SIGHS] You got any marking flags? So you hit "T" to zoom in, and "W" zooms back out.
See? Easy-peasy.
Just make sure to turn off the power to save energy there.
Listen.
Stay close to your brother, okay? And listen, listen, listen If you get a bad feeling or anything, you tell him to take you straight home.
- You promise? - Okay.
- Are you ready, bud? - Yeah.
Be safe.
[IMITATING DRACULA] I hope it doesn't suck! - [SNICKERS] - [CHUCKLES] [JONATHAN] I just don't get what she sees in him.
What? Bob.
At least he doesn't treat me different.
I mean, I can't even go trick-or-treating by myself.
It's lame.
What? You think I'm lame? No, but it's not like Nancy's coming to watch over Mike, you know? [SIGHS] [DUSTIN] Will! Hey! [CAR HORN HONKS] [DUSTIN] Hey, don't cross the streams.
Don't cross the streams! [SIGHS] Hey, listen.

You're the last thing he needs right now.
You're gonna see him.
Soon.
And not just in that head of yours.
You're gonna see him in real life.
I feel like I'm making progress with these people.

You say "soon" on day 205.

What do you say, big guy? Wanna go for a ride in the Bobmobile? Mr.
Henderson, you know the rules.
Five at a time.
Yep.
One, two, three, four and five.
Ten.
You already have five books checked out.
My mistake.
However I am on a curiosity voyage, and I need my paddles to travel.
These books These books are my paddles.
Five at a time.
- Are you shitting me? - Excuse me? What the hell is - Mr.
Henderson! - I need my paddles! Was that you I heard milling around last night, or was that a ghost? Yeah.
Me, probably.
- Another nightmare? - Um no.
Did I ever tell you about Mr.
Baldo? - Mr.
Baldo? - Yeah.
I was a little younger than you, standing in line for the Ferris wheel at the Roane County fair.
- Mmm-hmm.
- And suddenly, I feel this fat white glove tap me on the shoulder.
I spin around, and there he is.
Mr.
Baldo.
"Hey, kiddo, would you like a balloon?" Go ahead, laugh.
It's funny.
It wasn't funny back then, I can tell you that.
I couldn't get him out of my head.
Every night, he would come to me in my dreams.
And every night when he came to me I ran.
It got so bad that I made my mom stay in the room with me until I could fall asleep every night.
- Really? - Really.
It went on like that for months.
And then one day, the nightmares suddenly stopped.
- Wanna know how? - How? Well, I fell asleep and just like always, Mr.
Baldo came to me.
Only this time, I didn't run.
This time, I stood my ground.
I just looked at Mr.
Baldo in his stupid face, and I said, "Go away.
Go away!" Just like that, he was gone.
Never saw him again.
Easy-peasy, right? Easy-peasy.
Just like that.
I still don't get why they call him zombie boy.
I mean, I get it.
He got lost in the woods for a week or something, but why is he a zombie? Because everyone thought he was dead? Yeah.
I mean, we had a funeral for him and everything.
After a week? Well, see, some other kid drowned at the quarry.
We thought it was Will because his body was super decomposed.
What? Okay, that's not funny.
It's not a joke, all right? It's public knowledge.
You can ask anybody.
Except Will, because he is really sensitive about it.
All right? Okay.
Have a great day, kiddo.
The case of Phineas Gage is one of the great medical curiosities of all time.
Phineas was a railroad worker in 1848 who had a nightmarish accident.
A large iron rod was driven completely through his head.
Phineas miraculously survived.
He seemed fine.
And physically, yes, he was.
But his injury resulted in a complete change to his personality.
So much so that friends that knew him started referring to him as "No longer Gage.
" At the time, this was known as the American Crowbar Case.
Although it wasn't a I am so sorry, Mr.
Clarke.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Please continue with the class.
Don't mind me.
Really, continue, please.
Thanks.
Although it wasn't a crowbar, it was a rod, as I said.
We have to meet.
All of us.
At lunch, AV Club.
Why? I have something that you won't believe.
AV Club.
Lunch.
- Dustin! - Yes, my lord? - Would you care to join the class now? - Please, yes.

And he began to curse, using terrible words that I don't dare repeat here.
And we found some more by Gilbert's farm.
Some real nasty stuff.
- It was sticky.
- All right.
Where else? That was it, Chief.
That was it, or you get tired of looking? - It was getting dark.
- I mean, it was really dark.
They're called flashlights, you dipshits.
Oh, okay.
Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.
More lady problems, Chief? Hey, Chief! Where you going? You want us to go back out there? - Why's he gotta kick the door? - Hey, Chief! My granddad used to live here.
Long time ago.
I mainly just use it for storage now.
Lot of history here.
So, uh what do you think? It's a work-in-progress.
You know, it's, uh It takes a little imagination, but, uh once we fix it up, it's gonna be nice.
Real nice.
This is your new home.
Home.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
All right, this this is music.
All right.
Let's get to work.
Give me those.
Okay.
Now, this is called a trip wire.
It's like an alarm.
You, uh, set it up like this.
And then, anybody gets close, it's gonna make a loud noise like, uh, gunfire.
Bang! Those bad men aren't gonna find ya.
All right? Not way the hell out here.
We'll take some precautions.
There's gonna be a couple ground rules.
Rule number one: always keep the curtains drawn.
Rule number two: only open the door if you hear my secret knock.
And rule number three: don't ever go out alone, especially not in the daylight.
That's it.
Three rules.
I call 'em the, uh Don't Be Stupid Rules.
'Cause we're not stupid.
Right? Not stupid.
Harrington, right? I heard you used to run this school.
That true? King Steve, they used to call you, huh? Then you turned bitch.
Hey, maybe you should just shut up and just play the game.
Whoo! That's what I'm talking about! Whoo! Steve? - What are you doing here? - What do you think? Where were you this morning? I missed first period.
I figured Jonathan would take you.
Wha What are you talking about? Jesus, you really can't handle your alcohol.
Uh You remember going to Tina's party last night, right? - Yes.
- And then what? I remember dancing, and spilling some punch.
You got mad at me because I was drunk and then you took me home.
No, see, that's where your mind gets a little bit fuzzy.
That was your other boyfriend.
That was That was Jonathan.
- I don't understand.
- It's pretty simple, Nancy.
- You were just telling it like it is.
- What? Uh apparently, uh we killed Barb and I don't care, 'cause I'm bullshit and our whole our whole relationship is bullshit, and I mean, pretty much everything is just bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.
Oh, yeah, also, you don't love me.
I was drunk, Steve.
I don't remember any of that.
So that makes everything that you said It's what? Just bullshit, too? - Yes.
- Well, then tell me.
Tell you what? You love me.
Really? Harrington! Dude, we need you, man.
That douchebag's killing us.
Let's go! - All right! - Come on! I think that you're bullshit.
His name is d'Artagnan.
Cute, right? - D'Artagnan? - Dart for short.
- And he was in your trash? - Foraging for food.
- You wanna hold him? - No, no.
- He doesn't bite.
- I don't want to Oh, God, he's slimy! Ugh, he's like a living booger.
Ugh, oh, God! What is he? My question exactly.
At first, I thought it was some type of pollywog.
- Pollywog? - It's another word for tadpole.
- A tadpole is the larval stage of a toad.
- I know what a tadpole is.
All right, then you know that most tadpoles are aquatic, right? Well, Dart, he isn't.
He doesn't need water.
Yeah, but aren't there nonaquatic pollywogs? Terrestrial pollywogs? Yep.
Two to be exact.
Indirana semipalmata.
And the Adenomera andreae.
One's from India, one's from South America.
So how did one end up in my trash? Maybe some scientists brought it here, and it escaped? Do you guys see that? Looks like something is moving inside of it.
Whoa.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I got you, little guy.
I know you don't like that.
It's okay.
And there's another thing.
Reptiles, they're cold-blooded.
Ectothermic, right? They love heat, the sun.
Dart hates it.
It hurts him.
So, if he's not a pollywog or a reptile Then I've discovered a new species.
We gotta show him to Mr.
Clarke.
- What if he steals my discovery? - He's not gonna steal your discovery.
You know, I'm thinking about calling it Dustonious pollywogus.
- What do you think? - I think you're an idiot.
When I become rich and famous for this one day, don't come crawling back, saying, "Oh, my God, Dustin, I'm so sorry for being mean to you back in 8th grade.
Oh, my God.
" - Have a nice day.
- Thank you.
Baloney? Mmm.
- Last night was fun.
- Mmm-hmm.
I'm sorry if I overstepped anything.
No! No, you didn't.
Okay.
I mean I I like you so much.
Not just you, everything that comes with you.
Your family, your boys.
And I hope it's not wishful thinking, but I kinda feel like I'm breaking through with them.
Not so much Jonathan.
He's a tough cookie to crack, but Yeah.
With Will, I don't know, I feel like we're connecting.
He likes you, too.
- Yeah? - Mmm-hmm.
I can tell.
Good.
Oh, there was something else I was gonna mention, but It's not a big deal at all, but I just noticed this morning that my JVC was a little dinged up.
- Your what? - The video camera.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
It still works fine and everything.
I just I went back and watched the tape and there were some older kids picking on Will.
- What? - They scared him.
Who were they? Were they the Zimmerman brothers again? Um, I don't know.
They were wearing masks or sort of makeup and Maybe.
They were the right age.
I'll kill them.
I swear to God, I will I will kill them.
That's what I love about you.
You punch back.
I was never really one to put up a fight.
I struggled a lot like Will when I was a kid.
With bullies.
It's the ones like us, that don't punch back, that people really take advantage of, you know? They rub your nose in it, just a little bit more.
I don't know why they do that.
Maybe it makes them feel powerful.
I don't know.
But, hey, look at me now.
I get to date Joyce Byers.
Ha! Are you kidding me? I get to date It all works out in the end, doesn't it? Yes, it does.
Grass, crops, trees.
Everything in this area is either dead or dying, and that's a radius of over three miles.
And it all leads back to here.
See, these patterns here are really pretty.
I like the design.
It's almost psychedelic.
- This is a joke to you, huh? - No, it's not a joke.
I just I don't understand what this has to do with me, Chief Hopper.
Whatever is happening is spreading from this place, from this lab.
That's impossible.
It's The last burn was two days ago.
It's contained.
- What if there's a leak? - A leak? - I don't know, man.
You're the scientist.
- Exactly.
And I'm telling you there's nothing to worry about.
- Convince me.
- Convince you? Yeah.
You and your egghead friends go out there to every area on this map and you run your tests, or whatever the hell it is you do, and you see if anything comes up.
All right, so So you're you're giving me orders now? No.
- I keep things nice and quiet for you - Mmm-hmm.
And you keep your shit out of my town.
That is the deal.
I have done my part, now you do yours.
Convince me.
So, he asked you to take me home? Yeah.
Yeah, he was upset.
I mean, he was He was really upset.
But he was still worried about you.
Hey.
You need to cut yourself some slack, okay? People say stupid things when they're wasted.
Things they don't mean.
Yeah, but that's the thing.
What if I did mean it? All this time, I've been trying so hard to pretend like everything's fine, but it's not.
I I feel like there's this I don't know, like this Like there's this weight you're carrying around with you.
All the time.
I feel it, too.
Yeah, but it's different for you.
Will came home.
Yeah.
Yeah, he did.
But he's not the same.
I try to be there for him, you know, to help him, but I don't know.
I mean, maybe maybe things just can't go back to the way they were.
Doesn't that make you mad? Mad? Yeah, that those those people who did this, who ruined so many lives, they just get away with it.
The people responsible for this - they're dead.
- Do you really believe that? Your mom's boyfriend.
- He works at RadioShack, right? - Yeah.
Why? What are you thinking? Do you wanna skip fourth period? Isn't this fun? Pump your feet.
"I would feel so sad if I thought I was a disappointment to her because she didn't live very long after that, you see.
She died of a fever when I was just three months old.
I do wish she'd lived long enough for me to remember calling her mother.
I think it would be so sweet to say 'mother.
'" Do I have a mother? Yeah, of course you have a mother.
You couldn't really be born without one.
Where is she? She She's not around anymore.
Gone? Yeah.
I'm sorry about that, kid.
"And, uh, father died four days afterwards from fever, too.
That left me an orphan and folks were at their wits' end, so Mrs.
Thomas said to me, what to do with me.
You see, nobody wanted me even then.
It seems to be my fate.
" Is your mom here? Sweetie? School.
Where is school? The school? It's, uh it's about a mile that way.
At least.
Where are your parents? Look, Mommy, look.
RadioShack, Bob Newby speaking.
How can I help ya? Bob, it's Joyce.
Hey, Joyce, how ya doing? Hey, um I'm trying to watch your video thingy, and the tape, it's it's tiny.
It's like it's shrunk.
That's 'cause it's a VHS-C, not a VHS.
You gotta find the RF-P1U with coaxial cable so you can connect the video ins and outs.
Bob, English.
Right.
Sorry.
Um No, yeah, I did the coaxial things in the back, so I This one just goes into the camera itself? - Yeah.
Yeah, exactly.
- It's blue.
I think it's working.
I was thinking maybe tonight Joyce? So you hit T to zoom in, and W zooms back out.

Clarke.
What? What? It's about d'Artagnan.
This is the reason I was late for class.
Pretty neat.
These doors function? Well, yeah, obviously.
But it's not about the trap.
It's what's inside.
Now, this very well may change your perception of the world.
Consider my interest piqued.
All right, first, let's just clarify that this is my discovery, not yours.
Dustin, Jesus! Just show him! - I'm just trying to clarify - Dustin! Okay, fine.
Stop! I'm sorry, Mr.
Clarke.
It was just a stupid prank.
- What are you doing? - I told him to stop.
We need to go.
- Mike! - Right now.
Right now! So, your sister coming or what? Screw it.
That little shit can skate home.
- And don't call her that.
- What? Sister.
She's not my sister.
Hello? Hello? - Guys, come on.
Can I come in yet? - No! - I don't understand.
- What do you not understand? Will saw something that looked like Dart last year? Kind of, but there was no tail.
But then he heard it yesterday.
The exact same sound.
- Why didn't you tell us before? - I wasn't sure.
- A coincidence.
- Or not.
What if when Will was stuck in the Upside Down, he somehow acquired True Sight? True Sight? It gives you the power to see into the ethereal plane.
Elaborate.
Maybe these episodes that Will keeps having aren't really flashbacks at all.
Maybe they're real.
Maybe Will can somehow see into the Upside Down.
- So that would mean - Dart is from the Upside Down.
- We have to take him to Hopper.
- I agree.
No way.
If we take him to Hopper, Dart's good as dead.
- Maybe he should be.
- How can you say that? How can you not? He's from the Upside Down.
Maybe.
But even if he is, it doesn't automatically mean that he's bad.
That's like saying just because someone's from the Death Star - doesn't make them bad.
- We have a bond.
A bond? Just because he likes nougat? No, because he trusts me! He trusts you? Yes, I promised I would take care of him.
Guys, what's going on? Come on.
- Don't hurt him.
- Only if he attacks.
Just open it already.
Holy shit! Oh, shit! No! What the Oh, shit! Where'd he go? - What was that? - Dart! - What? - You let him escape! - Why did you attack him? - Come on.
Don't hurt him.
Don't you hurt him! Jonathan? Uh Mrs.
Wheeler.
- What a pleasant surprise.
- Yeah.
- Uh, we have a test tomorrow.
- Hmm.
- Oh, did you go shopping? - Oh, uh, yeah.
My Walkman broke.
- Aw! - Bummer.
Anyway, we should go.
It's a really big test.
- Yeah.
- So - Stressful.
- Very.
- Bye, Mrs.
Wheeler.
- Bye! It's good to see you.
Okay, are you sure about this? No.
Hello.
Marsha speaking.
Hello? Hello? Mrs.
Holland.
Hi, it's, um it's Nancy.
Nancy? I, uh I need to tell you something.
Something about Barb.
About that night.
I, uh I, uh I haven't been honest with you.
But I can't tell you here on the phone.
Meet me tomorrow, Forrest Hills Park, 9:00 a.
m.
Don't tell anyone.
And don't call me back here.
It's dangerous.
Nancy, what is this? I just need you to trust me.
Please.
Well, you were right about these pumpkins.
Some nasty stuff.
And the smell Gee, mother of God.
What exactly do you think is going on Well, I told you what I think.
But we'll run the tests, and we'll see what comes up.
In the meantime, I just need you to keep the area clear for us.
I don't think it'll be more than a day or two.
What do you want me to tell people? I'm sure you'll figure something out.
- Hey, Chief, you copy? - Yeah.
Do you remember that Russian girl Murray was going on about the other day? Yeah, well, now I'm thinking he's not so crazy after all.
Stay where you are.
Do not move.
East is clear.
No sign of Dart.
Where'd you go, you little bastard? West is clear, too.
Will? South is clear.
Lucas? Anything? Excuse me! Mr.
Sinclair! Sorry, I was looking for study hall.
Bye.
Nothing here, man.
- What the hell are you doing? - What are you doing? - Why are you in here? - Looking for Dart.
- This is the boys' room.
- Yeah, so? So you should go home.
- Why do you hate me so much? - I don't hate you.
How can I hate you? I don't know you.
But you don't want me in your party.
- Correct.
- Why not? Because you're annoying.
Also, we don't need another party member.
I'm our paladin, Will's our cleric, Dustin's our bard, Lucas is our ranger, and El is our mage.
- El? Who's El? - Someone.
No one.
Someone or no one? She was in our party a long time ago.
She moved away, okay? She was a mage? Well, what could she do? Like, magic tricks or something? Well, I could be your zoomer.
- That's not even a real thing.
- It could be.
- See? Zoomer.
- Mind-blowing.
Come on, you know you're impressed.
I don't see any tricks.
You're just going around in a circle.
If it's so easy, you try it.
- No.
- Why not? I don't know how.
So, then you admit it's kind of impressive.
I think if I spent, like, all day practicing, I could do that.
I would give you a million bucks if you could.
Okay, you're making me dizzy.
- Please just stop.
- I'll stop when I join your party.
- Come on, just stop.
- It's a simple question.
Am I in or out? Jesus! Are you all right? Yeah, yeah.
I think so.
- What happened? - I don't know.
It was like a magnet or something pulling on my board.
I know that sounds crazy.
Come on, come on, come on! Hawkins Middle.
May I help you? Yes.
Hi, Doris.
It's Joyce.
- Uh, Joyce Byers.
- Joyce.
Uh, Will has AV Club today.
Could you transfer me to Mr.
Clarke? - Mr.
Clarke? Huh.
You know what? - What? I just saw him leave for the day.
Maybe AV was canceled? - What? - Would you like me to Guys - I found him.
- Where? In the bathroom by Mr.
Salerno's.
Copy that.
It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Hey, buddy.
Come here.
You know I won't hurt you.
It's okay.
It's just me.
You're okay.
- Let's go.
Down here.
- We're coming! Stay low.
Keep quiet.
Where's Dart? - I don't know.
Not here.
- What? - He said by Salerno's, right? - Yeah, maybe Will has him.
Where is Will? Only this time, I didn't run.
This time, I stood my ground.
I said, "Go away.
Go away!" Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Easy-peasy, right? Easy-peasy.
Just like that.
----------
[VEHICLE APPROACHING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [DUSTIN AND MAX] Will! [DUSTIN] Will! - Dustin! - Mrs.
Byers? What's going on? Where's Will? [PANTS] The field! Will.
I just found him like this! I think he's having another episode! Will! Will! Will! Sweetie, wake up! It's Mom! Will! [CHOKING] Will, wake up! Can you hear me? [CHOKING] Will, please, just wake up.
Please, wake up! [CHOKING] It's Mom! It's me! [CHOKING] [GASPS] [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] Okay, that totally freaked me out.
Did that not freak you guys out? - [LUCAS] Two episodes in two days.
- It's getting worse.
You think it's True Sight? What's True Sight? - [CAR ENGINE STARTS] - It's nothing.
[WILL] I can't remember.
[SIGHS] I need you to try.
I I was on the field and and then it it all just went blank, and and then you were there.
Will, I need you to tell me the truth.
[STUTTERS] I am.
[SIGHS] This shape, I saw it on the video tape from Halloween night.
It's the same shape as as your drawing.
[JOYCE SIGHS] These episodes that you're having, I think Dr.
Owens is wrong.
I think they're real.
But but I can't help you if I don't know what's going on.
So, you have to talk to me.
Please.
No more secrets, okay? Okay.
Did did you see this thing again on the field? Yes.
What what is it? I don't know.
[STAMMERING] It's almost more like a feeling.
Like the one you had that night at the arcade? Yes.
[STUTTERS] What does it want? I don't know.
It came for me, and [YELLING] Go away! And I tried.
I tried to make it go away.
But it got me, Mom.
Well, what does that mean? [CRYING] I felt it everywhere.
Everywhere.
I I still feel it.
[SOBBING] I just want this to be over.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Hey.
- Listen.
Look, look at me.
- [SNIFFLES] I will never, ever let anything bad happen to you ever again.
Whatever's going on in you, we're gonna fix it.
I will fix it.
I promise.
I'm here.
[SHUDDERING] [SIGHS] "Friends don't lie.
" Isn't that your bullshit saying? Hey, hey! Hey! Don't walk away from me! Where'd you go on your little field trip, huh? Where? Did you go see Mike? He didn't see me.
Yeah, well, that mother and her daughter did and they called the cops.
Now, did anyone else see you? Anyone at all? Come on, I need you to think! Nobody saw me! You put us in danger.
You realize that, right? You promised I go! And I never leave! Nothing ever happens! Yeah! Nothing happens and you stay safe! You lie! I don't lie! I protect and I feed and I teach! And all I ask of you is that you follow three simple rules.
Three rules.
And you know what? You can't even do that! [BANGS] You're grounded.
You know what that means? It means no Eggos And no TV for a week.
All right, knock it off.
Let go.
[GRUNTS] Okay.
Two weeks.
Let go! - A month! - No! Well, congratulations.
You just graduated from no TV for a month to no TV at all! No! No! No.
No! You have got to understand that there are consequences to your actions.
You are like Papa! Really? I'm like that psychotic son of a bitch? Wow! All right.
You wanna go back in the lab? One phone call.
I can make that happen.
I hate you.
Yeah, well, I'm not so crazy about you, either.
You know why? 'Cause you're a brat.
You know what that word means? How about that be your word for the day, huh? Brat.
Why don't we look it up? B-R-A-T.
Brat.
Hey! What the hell is wrong with you? [GRUNTS] Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Open this door! Open the damn door! You wanna go out in the world? You better grow up! Grow the hell up! [SCREAMS] [SOBBING] Mom? Will? Hello? [MIKE] Do you like those grapes, Holly? Hey, Mom, I was thinking about staying the night at Stacey's tonight? We were gonna have a girl's night.
Romantic comedies, do our nails, gossip Sure! That sounds like fun.
- [TV PLAYING INDISTINCTLY] - [NANCY] Toast? No? - Hey.
- Hey.
Did you see your mom? No, she was sleeping.
But I left a note.
You don't have to do this, you know.
Stop saying that.
- [LINE RINGING] - [SIGHS] - [FLORENCE] Hawkins Police.
- Flo, it's Joyce again.
Oh, hi, Joyce.
Listen, I gave him your message - He's still not there? - No, but Did he get any of my messages from yesterday? Did you give - Yes, do you wanna talk to - No, no, I need Hopper.
Just tell him to call me the second he gets in.
Please.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
[SIGHS] Hey.
How you feeling, sleepyhead? - Any better? - Mmm-mmm.
Same as last night? Still weird? Yeah.
All right.
[SIGHS] Hmm.
Okay, let me see.
Is it a fever? No.
Uh, actually, it's cold.
Do you feel cold? No.
Just a little out of it.
Like I haven't really woken up yet.
You promised no doctor.
And I meant it.
No doctor.
You know what? I'm gonna run you a nice bath and it'll warm you up and hopefully get you feeling better.
How's that sound? Okay.
Morning, Dart.
Got you some breakfast.
Your favorite.
I gotta go to school, but I'll be back soon.
Sound good? [CHITTERS] [MIKE] Stop being a baby and do it already! [MAX] This is so disgusting.
Is this really necessary? What the hell's going on? What do you think? We're looking for Dart.
- Jesus! - [MAX] Oh! [MIKE] Ugh! [GRUNTS] [LUCAS] Well, well, well.
Look who finally decided to show up.
After I drew the short straw.
Real convenient.
You stink! Hi, Max.
Hi.
- Where's Will? - He'll be here.
Are you just gonna stand there? Or you gonna help? [MR.
CLARKE] All living things, from complex mammals to single-celled organisms, instinctively respond to danger.
Expose a bacterium to a toxic chemical, and it will flee.
Or deploy some other defense mechanism.
We're very much the same.
When we encounter danger, our hearts start pounding.
[WATER DRIPPING] Our palms start to sweat.
These are the signs of the physical and emotional state we call fear.
[HOPPER] Hey, you reached Jim.
I'm probably doing something incredible right now and I can't Mom.
Yeah, sweetie, what is it? It's too hot.
[SIGHS] I I can cool it down a little bit, baby, - but we gotta get your body temp back up.
- No.
What? He likes it cold.
Hey, kid.
Listen, um about last night, I, uh I want this place cleaned up by the time I get back and then maybe I'll consider fixing the TV.
You hear me? [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] [FLORENCE ON RADIO] Come in, Hop.
Come in, Hop.
Come in, Hop.
[GRUNTS SOFTLY] Yeah.
Yeah, I'm on my way in, and, yes, I do know what time it is.
Joyce Byers has called eight times already this morning.
Eight times.
For my sake, please deal with her! [WHISTLE BLOWS] [COACH] Let's go.
Pass it up now.
Get open! [LAUGHS] All right! All right, all right! King Steve.
King Steve, everyone.
I like it.
Playing tough today.
Jesus! Do you ever stop talking? Come on! [LAUGHS] What? You afraid the coach is gonna bench you now that I'm here? Huh? [GRUNTS] You were moving your feet.
Plant them next time, draw a charge.
[WHISTLE BLOWS] [SNIFFING] Don't sweat it, Harrington.
Today's just not your day, man.
Yeah.
Not your week.
You and the princess break up for one day, she's running off with the freak's brother.
[CHUCKLES] Oh, shit.
You don't know.
Jonathan and the princess skipped yesterday.
Still haven't shown.
But that must just be a coincidence, right? [LAUGHS] Don't take it too hard, man.
A pretty boy like you has got nothing to worry about.
Plenty of bitches in the sea.
Am I right? I'll be sure to leave you some.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SIGHS] It's 15 past.
Yeah, I know.
Just give him time.
That guy.
There.
- What? - He just just talked to himself.
[CHILDREN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] [CHILD] Duck, duck, duck, - duck, duck - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Duck, duck, duck Duck, duck, duck Duck [KIDS LAUGH] Duck, duck Goose! I think we should go.
[STALLING] [GASPS] Trouble with your car, miss? I can give you two a lift if you like.
[NANCY] Jonathan.
You sure you don't need that ride? Hello? [JOYCE] Leave it open.
Where the hell have you been? I overslept.
What the hell's going on? It's freezing.
Hey! Knock, knock.
We have a visitor.
[HOPPER] So this thing, this shadow thing.
You told your mom it likes it like this.
It likes it cold? Yeah.
How do you know that? I just know.
Does he talk to you? No.
It's like I don't have to think.
I just know things now.
Things I never did before.
[HOPPER] And, uh what else do you know? [WILL] It's hard to explain.
It's like old memories in the back of my head, only they're not my memories.
Okay.
I mean, I don't think they're old memories at all.
They're they're now-memories, happening all at once, now.
Can you describe these now-memories? I don't know.
It's it's hard to explain.
[JOYCE] I know it's hard but can you just Can you try? For us? It's like They're growing and spreading killing.
The memories? I don't know.
Oh! - [CRYING] I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.
It's okay, sweetie.
Hey, hey, sweetie what if you didn't have to use words? [PHONE RINGING] [CONTINUES RINGING] Hey, you've reached the Byers.
We're sorry [LUCAS] Anything? We need to talk.
AV room.
Right now.
Party members only.
Come on, Mike.
No! This is non-negotiable.
- Sorry, Max.
- Sorry.
[MIKE] Will didn't want me to tell anyone, but on Halloween night he saw a sort of shadow in the sky.
A shadow? [STAMMERS] What kind of shadow? I don't know.
But it scared him.
And if Will really has True Sight I mean, if he can really see into the Upside Down, maybe he saw that shadow again yesterday.
- So that's why he was frozen like that? - Maybe.
Can it hurt him? I mean, if this shadow thing isn't from our world I'm not sure.
Dustin? Well, if you're in another plane, you can't interact with the material plane, so theoretically, no, the shadow can't hurt him.
Yeah, if that's even what's happening.
This isn't D & D.
This is real life.
So what do we do? We acquire more knowledge.
I'll go to Will's after school.
See what's going on.
You guys stay here and find Dart.
Dart? What's he gotta do with this? Will heard him in the Upside Down.
I don't know how yet, but he's gotta be connected to all this.
He's gotta be.
If we find Dart, maybe we can solve this thing.
Maybe we can help Will.
[SIGHS] [BLOWS] [GRUNTING] Hey! Hey, assholes! Let us out of here! [OWENS] Oh! Not very pleasant in here, is it? Sorry about that.
Hospitality's not our strong suit.
You know, scientists and all.
Yeah.
Okay.
You up for a little walk? - I'm assuming you're behind me.
- [DOOR OPENS] "Men of science have made abundant mistakes of every kind.
" George Sarton said that.
You guys know who George Sarton is? Doesn't really matter.
The point is, mistakes have been made.
Yes.
- Mistakes? - Yes.
You killed Barbara.
Abundant mistakes, but, the men involved with those mistakes, the ones responsible for what happened to your brother and Miss Holland's death, they're gone.
They're gone, and for better for worse, I'm the schmuck they brought in to make things better.
But I can't make things better without your help.
You mean without us shutting up? [SIGHS] She's tough, this one.
You guys been together long? - We're not together.
- Wanna see what really killed your friend? Teddy, I brought you an audience today.
I hope you don't mind.
[TEDDY] More the merrier, sir.
[OWENS] I'd call it one hell of a mistake.
Wouldn't you? See, the thing is, we can't seem to erase our mistake but we can stop it from spreading.
Like, it's like pulling weeds.
But imagine for a moment if a foreign state, let's say, the Soviets If they heard about our mistake do you think they would even consider that a mistake? What if they tried to replicate that? The more attention we bring to ourselves, the more the more people like the Hollands know the truth, the more likely that scenario becomes.
You see why I have to stop the truth from spreading, too.
Just, same as those weeds there.
By whatever means necessary.
[SCREECHING] So, we understand each other now, don't we? This is more of the same.
Oh, it's nothing.
It's just scribbles.
Wait! - What? What? - Wait.
- Wait.
These black lines, see? - [HOPPER] What? Look, they connect.
They connect.
[GRUNTING] Does this mean anything to you? No.
[SIGHS] I mean, is it some sort of maze or a road? [STAMMERS] I mean, it's sort of forking and branching like like lightning.
You think it's that storm? No, the storm he drew was completely different.
He used red.
And this is all blue and it has some weird dirt color.
I mean, maybe it's roots.
'Cause remember, he was saying it was spreading and Killing.
He said they were killing.
Vines.
He's drawing vines.
[RINGING] Hey, Max.
Have you seen Dustin? We're supposed to meet after class.
Max! Hey, Max! Hey, where you going? Come on! We've gotta go look for Dart.
Yeah, good luck with that.
[LUCAS] What is wrong with you? What is wrong with me? What's wrong with you? - I don't understand.
- No! I don't understand! You guys act like you want me to be your friend but then you treat me like garbage! - That's not true! - Yes, it is! You go and hide in the AV Club, keeping secrets like we're in second grade or something.
You know, I thought you guys wanted me in your party.
- We do.
But it's - But what? [SIGHS] There there are just things.
Things we can't tell you, all right? For your own safety.
- My own safety? - Yes! - Because I'm a girl? - What? No! Did you keep secrets from El? How do you know about El? Did you? That was different.
Trust me.
Okay? That was just just different.
Okay.
You know what? Forget it, okay? I don't wanna be in your stupid party anyway.
I'm out.
Have a nice life.
- Max! - You still stink, by the way! [SNIFFS] Oh, shit! That kid you were talking to, who is he? [MAX] He's no one.
- No one? - This kid from my class.
Why was he talking to you? It was just about a stupid class assignment.
- Then why're you so upset? - I'm not! He causing you trouble? Why do you care? Because, Max, you're a piece of shit, but we're family now whether we like it or not, meaning I'm stuck looking out for you.
- What would I ever do without - Hey! This is serious shit, okay? I'm older than you.
And something you learn is that there are a certain type of people in this world that you stay away from, and that kid, Max That kid is one of them.
You stay away from him, you hear me? Stay away.

-----------
1 Hey, you reached Jim.
I'm probably doing something incredible right now, and I can't It's like It's like I feel what the shadow monster's feeling.
See what he's seeing.
Like in the Upside Down? Some of him is there.
But some of him is here, too.
- Here, like, in this house? - In this house and in me.
It's like It's like he's reaching into Hawkins more and more.
And the more he spreads, the more connected to him I feel.
And the more you see these now-memories.
At first I just felt it in the back of my head.
I didn't even really know it was there.
It's like when you have a dream and you can't remember it unless you think really hard.
It was like that.
But know it's like Now I remember.
I remember all the time.
Maybe - Maybe that's good.
- Good? Just think about it, Will.
You're like a spy now.
A superspy.
Spying on the shadow monster.
If you know what he's seeing and feeling maybe that's how we can stop him.
Maybe all of this is happening for a reason.
- You really think so? - Yeah.
Yeah, I really do.
What if he figures out we're spying on him? - What if he spies back? - He won't.
How do you know? We won't let him.
Ugh! Ugh! - Hey.
- Hey.
Did you get 'em? Yeah.
We'd like a uh, a room.
We got those.
You want a single or a double? Double.
Nance - Uh, on or off? - Hmm.
- What? - Nothing.
Just dÃ©jÃ  vu.
Yeah.
Don't you think it's weird? What? How we only seem to hang out when the world's about to end? It's not going to end.
Feels like it.
Still have yours? - Yeah.
- Mmm Yeah, mine's bigger.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
What happened? What do you mean? To us? After everything, you just disappeared.
Yeah, Will needed me.
And Steve I waited.
Yeah, like, only a month.
I want them off.
Will, what's wrong? Mom? Mom? - Mom? - Yeah? - I saw him.
- You saw who, baby? Hopper.
I think he's in trouble.
I think he's going to die.
Shit! - That's enough, Erica.
- Uh-uh.
- Dad? - Mmm-hmm? When Mom's mad at you, how do you make her not mad? Hmm.
That's a great question.
How do you, hon? First, I apologize.
Then, I get your mother whatever she wants.
Even when she's wrong? She's never wrong, son.
That's right.
- Not hungry? - Not really.
Where you goin'? To hang out with Dustin.
Sorry.
Mews! Mewsy! Mews! Mewsy! Dusty, baby, you're sure she's not in your room? Uh-huh.
If you'd like to make a call Thank you so much, Mr.
McCorkle.
Thank you so much.
You are a true lifesaver.
All right, this was great.
Thank you.
All right.
Have a good one.
Bye-bye, now.
All right.
You, too.
All right, great news.
They found her? No.
But they saw her wandering around Loch Nora.
How did the poor baby get all the way out there? I don't know.
Lost, I guess.
But they're gonna look for her.
And I'll stay here, just in case they call again.
And you're gonna go help look? Yeah? Yeah? Give me hug.
Give me a hug.
Go get her.
- You're gonna find her.
- Okay.
- We can find her.
- We can find her.
I love you.

Five-fifteen.
All right, "Five-fifteen.
" Sure.
Thank you.
Hey.
You apologize to your mama, yeah? Huh? Must be scared half to death.
How long's it been? Long time.
Go away! I'm not interested! Look, I don't want your Thin Mints, all right, kid? - Thin Mints? - Or your religious mumbo jumbo.
Whatever you're selling, I ain't buying, okay? I want to see Mama.
Name a way you occupy your time when you're having a boring day at work.
- Drink coffee.
- "Drink coffee," said Mike.
Yeah! Five answers will beat it, Lynn.
Visit with other employees.

Are you positive this is the right place? "3833.
" Yeah.
All right.
Look at the camera.
- The camera.
- What camera? Not the loudspeaker.
Above you, to the right.
Nancy Wheeler.
Jonathan Byers.
You two are a long way from home.
Well I hope you didn't come all this way to tell me about the bear in the Harrington kid's backyard.
I've heard that one already.
Take a look.
Go ahead, don't be shy.
I followed up on 200 tips, most bogus, but that's how these things always go, okay? I know every last step Barbara took that day, every last person she talked to.
The answer to what happened to your friend, it's up here somewhere.
I assure you that.
I just gotta connect the right dots.
Timeline's wrong.
I'm sorry? Your timeline is wrong.
And the girl with the buzzed hair, she's not Russian.
She's from Hawkins Lab.
Her name was Eleven.
You might wanna sit down for this.
If you're not out in an hour Walking home.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Hey! Watch the attitude, shitbird.
Sorry about that, Road Warrior.
What happened? Short circuit in the motherboard.
A real bummer.
But fret not.
I got another machine up and running in the back.
Hold these.
You better get me that date now, Sinclair.
I told you I would.
And keep things PG in here, all right? What is this shit, stalker? Sorry.
I just needed a safe place.
A safe place to what? Be creepy? Listen.
I'm gonna tell you the truth about everything that happened last year.
But if anyone finds out, you could be arrested.
Possibly killed.
- Killed? - I need to know.
Do you accept the risk? - Oh, my God! This this is so stupid.
- Do you accept the risk? Yeah.
Sure.
Fine.
I accept the risk.
Let's hear it.
Last year Will didn't get lost in the woods.
He got lost somewhere else.
Hey, is this where you saw him? Is this where you saw Hopper? I think so.
Yeah.
Okay.
Here! Okay, so so Hopper is here? Yeah.
Now we just need to find out where here is, right? Right.
Did he say anything? I mean, before he left? Uh, some something about vines? Hopper.
Surprise.
I would've called, but you said not to clog up the line.
You know, I We're fine, we don't need anything.
When I was sick as a kid, and I was sick all the time as a kid, nothing made me feel better than focusing on these brain teasers.
Those are great.
Ah I could teach him how to play.
You know, he's sleeping.
Okay.
I could wait with you? Listen, it's just not a good time.
But, um, you know what? I'll call you, okay? Thank you.
- You sure? - Yeah.
Well, have him call me.
They don't call me Bob the Brain for nothing.
Bob! That's my name.
Huh.
Hmm.
- You drew all these yourself? - Mmm-hmm.
- Why, exactly? - I I told you the rules.
- No questions, okay? - Yeah.
We we just need you to help us figure out what Bob? Bob? Over here.
Where where this is.
That's the objective.
Find the X.
Yeah? What's at the X? Pirate treasure? Bob, no questions.
Okay.
Let me talk to you for a second.
Hang on, guys.
Joyce, you can talk to me.
You know that, right? Yeah.
What's the problem, exactly? What's the problem? Joyce, Will doesn't look well.
You don't look well.
What's going on? Nothing.
Nothing.
Is this an episode? Is this one of Will's episodes? No.
No! No.
I'm sorry.
I just I don't see how any of this is good for Will, or for you.
And even if I wanted to play along, I mean, how could I figure anything out if I don't understand the context of the game? - Or - What? - What is it? - I know that shape.
It's Lovers' Lake.
It's Lovers' Lake.
I get it.
Okay, I get.
That's Lake Jordan.
And if that's Lake Jordan, then you can probably find Yeah, that's, uh, Sattler's quarry.
And if you just follow it naturally it moves to the Eno River.
And there it is.
That's the Eno, do you see it? Okay, so the lines aren't roads.
But they act like roads.
And they act like roads 'cause when you follow 'em, you'll see they don't go over water.
And that's the giveaway.
That's the giveaway.
Ha! Don't you get it? It's not a puzzle, it's a map.
It's a map of Hawkins.
Right, Will? Does anybody copy? Look, if anybody copies, this is Jim Hopper, Hawkins' Chief Guys, this is Dustin again.
Does anyone copy? This is a code red.
I repeat, a code red! I really need someone to pick up here.
Hopper's MIA, and I've got a code red.
Code red! All right, it's Dustin again.
Seriously, I have a code red.
Could you please shut up? Erica? Erica, is Lucas there? - Where is he? - Donât know.
Don't care.
Is he with Mike? Like I said, I don't know and I don't care.
Please tell him it's super important.
Please tell him that I have a code Code red? - Yep, code red.
Exactly.
- Mmm-hmm.
I got a code for you instead.
It's called code shut-your-mouth.
Erica? I just need a little help understanding, sweetie, okay? Can you tell me where you came from? Where you've been all this time? A policeman and a woman came looking for you last year.
Did they find you? She won't get better will she? They don't think so, no.
But she's not in any pain.
She's just stuck, they think.
Like in a dream.
A long dream.
A good dream? I hope so.
Is it the same dream? We don't know.
Sometimes she says different words.
But usually those.
She always believed that you were out there.
She always believed that you'd come home one day.
Home? Yeah, home.
Pretty.
I can get you a real bed, and you can stay here with me if you want.
How's that sound? I wanna help you, but to really do that, I need you to talk to me, okay? Doesn't have to be now.
Doesn't have to be today.
But when you're ready.
Okay? Okay.
Oh, yeah, that.
That happens sometimes.
Old house, bad wiring Or if you ask my crazy aunt Shirley, it's haunted.
Sweetie, really, it's just the wiring.
No.
It's Mama.
Sunflower.

She wants to talk.
Rainbow.

All right.
I'm 3.
6 inches, what do you got? I'm not sure.
Mrs.
Byers? Hold on.
Twenty-one feet, four inches.
What about Tippecanoe to Danford Creek? Danford? Where's Danford? Dining room.
Sixteen feet, ten inches.
What about Danford to Jordan? Oh, come on.
This has gotta be enough.
It's not.
It's it's really not.
Okay.
Can't you figure it out? Well, it's hard.
The ratio isn't exactly one-to-one.
I mean, if you're twisting my arm, and you are twisting my arm, I would say that the X is maybe a half mile southeast of Danford? Thank you.
Thank you.
What? Are we we really going? I don't know, Cath.
Maybe if it was Margaret Thatcher, that'd be another story.
Just a second, Cath.
Ted, can you get that please? Sorry.
I got it.
Your line has been busy for over two hours, Mr.
Wheeler.
- Do you realize this? - Oh, I do realize.
- Is Mike home? - No.
No? Well, where the hell is he? Karen, where's our son? Will's! - Will's.
- No one's picking up there.
Nancy.
What about Nancy? Karen, where's Nancy? - Ally's! - Ally's.
Our children don't live here anymore.
You didn't know that? - Seriously? - Am I done here? Son of a bitch.
You're really no help at all, you know that? Hey! Language.
Listen I've been thinking I love you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry? What the hell am I sorry for? Steve.
Are those for Mr.
or Mrs.
Wheeler? - No.
- Good.
- Hey.
What the hell? Hey! - Nancy isn't home.
- Where is she? - Doesn't matter.
We have bigger problems than your love life.
Do you still have that bat? - Bat? What bat? - The one with the nails? - Why? - I'll explain it on the way.
- Now? - Now! Son of a bitch! Wait.
Wait.
No, no! No! No! And that was the last we ever saw of her.
After that, she was just gone.
I can't believe it's been that long.
Feels like yesterday.
Yeah.
I mean, I bet.
- Wow.
- It's crazy.
I know.
It's crazy, but I really liked it.
- Liked it? - Yeah.
- Well, I mean, I had a few issues.
- Issues? I felt it was a little derivative in parts.
What are you talking about? I just wish it had a little more originality.
- That's all.
- You don't believe me? Lucas, come on, seriously? How gullible do you think I am? Why would I make this up? I don't know.
To impress me or something? Or you're just, like, insane.
I tell you all of this.
I mean, top-secret stuff.
Risking my life.
And this is how you react? Risking your life? - Oh, so this is funny to you? - Yeah.
I mean kind of funny.
Stupid, but funny.
Where are you going? Story time's over, isn't it? What's wrong with you? I gave you what you wanted.
I wanted to be a part of the group, not a part of some joke.
It's not a joke.
You did a good job, okay? You can go tell the others I believed your lies if it gets you experience points or whatever.
We have a lot of rules in our party, but the most important is, "Friends don't lie.
" Never ever.
No matter what.
Is that right? Then how do you explain this? I had to do that.
To protect you.
To protect me from who, exactly? The big bad government baddies from Hawkins Lab? Lower your voice.
Maybe it was to protect me from the Demogorgon from another dimension? - Max, I'm serious, shut up! - Oh, no, no! You know what it was? It was Eleven.
The girl Stop talking.
You're going to get us killed.
Do you understand? You're serious? I really wish I wasn't.
Prove it.
I can't.
So what? I'm supposed to just trust you? Yes.
Shit.
I gotta go.
Um Don't follow me out.
Okay? Do you believe me? The hell I tell you? I'm not late.
You know what I'm talking about.
Oh, Lucas? So he has a name now, huh? It's a small town, okay? We weren't hanging out.
Hmm.
Well, you know what happens when you lie.
I'm not lying.
What if they try to replicate that? The more attention we bring to ourselves, the more people like the Hollands who know the truth, the more likely that scenario becomes.
You see why I have to stop the truth from spreading, too.
Just the same as those weeds there.
By whatever means necessary.
So, is it enough? The tape recording, is it enough? Is it incriminating? - What are you doing? - Thinking.
With vodka? It's a central nervous system depressant.
So yes, with vodka.
Music? Really? Yes.
It helps me What? Think? How long is this gonna take? Longer if you keep talking.
Is the tape incriminating or not? It's a simple question.
There's nothing simple about it.
Nothing simple about anything you've told me.
You don't believe us, do you? I believe you, but that's not the problem.
You don't need me to believe you.
You need them to believe you.
- Them? - Them.
With a capital "T.
" Your priest, your postman, your teacher, the world at large.
They won't believe any of this.
That's why we made the tape.
Oh.
That's easy to bury.
Easy.
He admits it.
You heard it.
He admits culpability.
You're being naive, Nancy! Those people They're not wired like me and you, okay? They don't spend their lives trying to get a look at what's behind the curtain.
They like the curtain.
It provides them stability, comfort, definition.
This this would open the curtain, and open the curtain behind that curtain, okay? So the minute someone with an ounce of authority calls bullshit, everyone will nod their heads and say, "See? Ha! I knew it! It was bullshit.
" That is, if you even get their attention at all.
You're saying we did all of this for nothing? I'm saying, I'm thinking.
Ooh! This is ridiculous.
- That's it.
That's it! - What's it? It's just too strong.
Too strong.
Better.
Perfect.
We water it down.
- Precisely.
- Wait.
What? Your story.
We moderate it.
Just like this drink here.
We make it more tolerable.
Perhaps Barbara was exposed to some dangerous toxins.
A leak from the lab.
Like Three Mile Island or something.
Something scary but familiar.
Close enough that it hits the man right where it hurts.
And those assholes that killed Barb They'll go down.
All right, what are we looking at? This was some of the soil we took yesterday.
Okay.
So what is your concern? Well, we didn't find any signs of contamination.
Uh, nothing hazardous other than some pesticides.
Well, it's a farm.
Right, right.
Exactly.
But Like this? Yes.
It's okay if I sit here, right? Yes.
And I won't mess it up or anything? - No.
- Okay.
If you talk to Terry, will you tell her that I love her very much? And that I'm sorry that I didn't believe - Stop talking.
- Okay, sorry.

- Are Are we close? - We're in the vicinity.
What's that mean, the vicinity? It means we're close.
I don't know.
It's not precise.
But we did all that work.
I told you, the scale ratio is not exactly one-to-one.
We needed to take - Turn right.
- What? - I saw him.
- Where? Not here.
In my now-memories.
- In your what? - Turn right! Are you okay? Superspy.
What's Jim doing here? Joyce? Boys, I need you to stay here.
No.
Mom, Mom, Mom, it's not safe.
That's why I need you to stay here! Stay here! Hopper! Hey, be careful.
Just going down the hole.
Vines.
Give me that.
- The shovel? - Yes, give me the shovel.
I need you to help me get down there.
- Joyce, what are you talking about? - Bob! Now! Hopper! Hopper! Hopper! Joyce, what is going on? - Where are we? - Bob, are you okay? Tunnels.
Is this Will's map? Hopper! Are we in Will's map? Hopper! Hopper! We're in Will's map.
Hopper! We're actually inside of Will's map.
Hopper! How did he know all this? Bob! Over here! It's his.
He's gotta be this way.
Come on.
Hopper! Do you see anything? I mean, in your now-memories? Hopper! Hopper! What? This is Oh! It's his arm.
It's choking him.
Knife.
- Knife? - It's over there.
Okay.
Hands! Hands! Cut it Bastard! Oh, my God.
Hopper, are you okay? - Joyce.
- Are you okay? Are you okay? - Hey, Bob.
- Hey, Jim.
Oh, God! Go! Go! Go! Clear the area! - Go! - Wait.
Move, now! Will? Will, you okay? Will, what's wrong? 
----------
1 Get him out.
Go! Go! God! Hold on, sweetie! I'm right here.
Just hold on.
- Vitals? - Heart rate 220.
Temperature's 106.
Will, where does it hurt? All over.
She says he feels like he's burning.
Check for burns.
I don't see anything.
- Where does it hurt the most, Will? - Everywhere! Everywhere! Wait a sec.
How big? First it was like that.
Now he's like this.
I swear to God, man, it's just some little lizard, okay? - It's not a lizard.
- How do you know? How do I know if it's not? How do you know it's not just a lizard? Because his face opened up and he ate my cat.
I don't hear shit.
He's in there.
All right, listen, kid.
I swear, if this is some sort of Halloween prank, - you're dead.
- It's not.
- All right? - It's not a prank.
Get it out of my face.
You got a key for this thing? Let me see that.
He must be further down there.
I'll stay up here in case he tries to escape.
Steve? Steve, what's going on down there? Get down here.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit! No way.
No way.
That thing, it it did something to him.
Okay.
And these now-memories, as you call them, how long has he been experiencing them? I told you, since Thursday.
Since I found him in the field.
And why wasn't he brought in? I have been bringing him in, and what have you done? Nothing.
Nothing! These are new symptoms, Joyce.
No.
No, he has been telling you over and over that something's wrong, and you said it was all in his head.
You said, "Be patient.
" Those were your words.
I understand that you're upset, okay? I get it.
I would be, too, if I were in your shoes.
But we are all in the same boat here, - and I just need you to try - Wait? Stay calm? Trust you? No, I want him transferred to a real hospital.
Well, you know that's not possible.
He really will get the best treatment here, Mrs.
Byers.
The very best.
And what are you treating him for, exactly? Can anyone tell me what's wrong with him? Can a single person in this room tell me what is wrong with my boy? What is wrong with my boy? You see why I have to stop the truth from spreading, too.
Just the same as those weeds there.
By whatever means necessary.
Whoo-hoo! - To taking down the man.
- To taking down the man.
Commie bastards sure know how to make a spirit.
Am I right? Oh, no, no, no.
We we can't.
Yeah, no.
No, I've got to drive.
Drive? What, tonight? Our parents Would be proud if they knew what you were up to.
Just tell 'em you're at Tammy's or Dawn's or whoever's, and take my guest room.
- I mean, do do you want to stay? - Well, it is pretty late.
Okay.
Uh Could I use the sofa? Okay, I'm confused.
What's going on here? A lovers' quarrel? - No, no.
I mean, we're just friends.
- Friends.
You've told me a lot of shockers today, but that, that is the first lie.
- It's not a lie.
- No? You're young, attractive.
You've got chemistry, history, plus the real shit, shared trauma.
Trust issues, am I right? Something to do with your dad.
- What? No, I mean, my dad's - An asshole.
Hmm.
It is a curse to see so clearly.
You, you're harder to read.
Probably, like everyone, afraid of what would happen if you accepted yourself for who you really are and retreated back to the safety of - Name? Name? - Steve.
Oh.
Steve.
We like Steve.
Yes.
- But we don't love Steve.
- What? No, we I mean, I do.
There it is, ladies and germs, the second lie of the evening.
So, how'd I do? My goodness.
You two are adorable, aren't you? Listen there's a pull-out sofa in my study if you want it.
But if I were you, I'd cut the bullshit and share the damn bed.
Afraid.
Trust issues? Trust issues.
Retreat? I don't retreat.
Trust issues? I do not Oh.
Hey.
Hey.
I just, uh I I just wanted to say that Oh, no, don't I mean He's so drunk.
- Wasted.
- Yeah.
I mean, what? He knows us for a couple of hours, and he's got us all figured out? Exactly.
God.
Okay, yeah.
I feel I'm glad we feel the same way.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's fine.
Uh So, uh, good night, I guess.
Yeah, um, good night.
Oh, He-Man, thank you for saving my life.
What strong muscles you have.
- I knew it.
- Hey! They're in love! No, actually, they're not.
They don't even exist on the same planet.
Aren't you too old to be playing with toys? That that's not the point.
The point is to stay out of my room.
Then tell your little nerdy friend to shut his mouth.
What are you talking about? "Code red, Lucas.
Code red.
Code red.
" Bunch of nerds.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Dustin! This is Lucas.
Do you copy? Dustin? - Well, well, well, look who it is.
- Sorry, man.
My stupid sister turned it off.
Well, when you were having sister problems, Dart grew again, he escaped, and I'm pretty sure he's a baby Demogorgon.
- Wait.
What? - I'll explain later.
- Meet me and Steve at the old junkyard.
- Steve? And bring your binoculars and wrist rocket.
Steve Harrington? All right, let's go.
Just be there, stat.
Over and out.
All right, cowboy, good news.
We're giving you the green light.
How you feeling? Never better.
All right, well, got a present for ya.
- The hell is that? - Uh, something you should see.
Watch your step.
All living organisms develop defense mechanisms against attack.
They adapt.
They find some way to survive.
Oh, my God.
It's pretty impressive, isn't it? It's been spreading, growing beneath us like some cancer.
Why aren't you burning it? There's a complication.
They made me sign, like, a thousand documents.
I mean we all had to.
We had to.
I mean, I lost track at a certain point.
They're gonna make you do the same.
I'm sure.
Yeah.
Well, hey, whatever.
What kind of documents? Uh, confidentiality, and there were these official forms saying, like, nothing ever happened, which is why Will got lost in the woods.
Yeah.
Man, I always thought stuff like this happened in movies and comic books.
Certainly not in Hawkins, and certainly not to someone like you.
- Or you.
- Yeah.
Bob Newby, superhero.
You cold? Uh, just a little jitters, I guess.
Hey, don't you start worrying about me.
- Okay.
- Okay? I'm fine.
I'm fine.
It's not like you didn't warn me.
"This is not a normal family.
" - Isn't that what you said? - Yeah.
You weren't kidding.
It kinda makes my idea of moving to Maine sound a little less crazy, right? Oh, it it's not crazy at all.
Mom? Hey.
Is there a doctor? We need a doctor! Sweetie, how you feeling? You okay? Okay, they're on their way.
Hey.
- Who is that? - What? - What? - It's me, big guy.
It's Bob.
Are you a doctor? No.
No, it's just me.
Just just Bob.
So, Jonathan, how was the pull-out? Uh, sorry? The sofa.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it was good.
I bet.
Oops.
Mmm.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, we just, um We just had some fun girl time.
- Will you be back for dinner? - Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah, I'll be home real soon.
- Say hey to Ally for me.
Okay.
All right.
I love you, too, Mom.
Bye.
She said Mike's at your brother's house.
They just had a sleepover.
So Oh, okay.
Do you wanna try again? No.
No, it's fine.
They're probably just at the matinÃ©e or something.
Yeah, I'm sure.
For your travels.
And to water it down.
Got it.
Thank you for everything.
Don't thank me yet.
Just keep your eyes on the papers, hmm? And if you need to reach me again don't.
Twenty-one.
Twenty-two.
- Max, are you getting that or what? - Okay! Swear to God, Max! What are you doing here? - I have proof.
- What? Proof that what I told you was real.
But we have to hurry.
What kind of proof? Who the hell were you talking to? Mormons.
Mormons? Talkative ones.
Come on, hop on.
Hurry.
This better be good, stalker.
Do you know your name? Will.
- Your full name? - William Byers.
Do you know Do you know who I am? A doctor.
Have we met before? - I don't remember.
- Hmm.
You don't remember me? Okay.
How about, uh How about this guy here? Know who that is? It's all right.
Take your time.
That's my friend.
Mike.
What about me, kid? You remember me? They tell me you helped save me last night.
You remember that? Do you remember anything about last night? About what happened? I remember they hurt me.
You mean the doctors? No.
The soldiers.
The soldiers hurt you? They shouldn't have done that.
It upset him.
You say, "Upset him.
" Is that him? Okay.
Okay, I wanna try something.
It's gonna seem a little odd at first, but I think it's really gonna help us understand what's going on.
Is that okay? Okay.
Now, Will, I want you to just let us know if you feel anything.
Okay? - Do you feel anything? - Little sting.
It stings? Where? My chest.
- Okay, son.
- Sweetie - How about now? - It it burns.
Ah! - It burns.
- Where? Everywhere.
That's enough.
That's enough! Stop! You heard her! That's enough! That's it! We're done! Okay.
Sweetie Sweetie.
It's okay.
Our best guess right now is it's some kind of virus which is causing this neurological disorder.
Now, when when a typical virus attaches itself to its host it duplicates, right? It spreads, essentially hijacking the host.
A virus is alive.
It has an intelligence.
That's not That's not unusual.
What is so unusual here, this virus the infected hosts seem to be communicating.
It has some sort of a hive intelligence, and it's connecting all the hosts.
The good news is a virus can be cured.
We we're gonna continue to run tests.
We're gonna see what we find.
What happens when he can't remember anything? When there's nothing else there? What happens when my boy is gone? All right, so let me get this straight.
You kept something you knew was probably dangerous in order to impress a girl who who you just met? All right, that's grossly oversimplifying things.
I mean, why would a girl like some nasty slug anyway? An interdimensional slug? Because it's awesome.
Well, even if she thought it was cool, which she didn't, I I just I don't know.
I just feel like you're trying too hard.
Well, not everyone can have your perfect hair, all right? It's not about the hair, man.
The key with girls is just just acting like you don't care.
- Even if you do? - Yeah, exactly.
It drives them nuts.
- Then what? - You just wait until, uh - until you feel it.
- Feel what? It's like before it's gonna storm, you know? You can't see it, but you can feel it, like this, uh electricity, you know? Oh, like in the electromagnetic field when the clouds in the atmosphere No, no, no, no, no.
Like a Like a sexual electricity.
Oh.
You feel that and then you make your move.
So that's when you kiss her? - No, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, Romeo.
- Sorry.
Sure, okay, some girls, yeah, they want you to be aggressive.
You know, strong, hot and heavy, like a - I don't know, like a lion.
- Mmm.
But others, you gotta be slow, you gotta be stealthy, like a like a ninja.
What type is Nancy? Nancy's different.
She's different than the other girls.
Yeah, she seems pretty special, I guess.
Yeah.
Yeah, she is.
But this girl's special, too, you know.
It's just, like, something about her.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.
- What? You're not falling in love with this girl, are you? Uh, no.
No.
- Okay, good.
Don't.
- I won't.
She's only gonna break your heart, and you're way too young for that shit.
FabergÃ©.
What? It's FabergÃ© Organics.
Use the shampoo and conditioner, and when your hair's damp It's not wet, okay? - When it's damp - Damp.
You do four puffs of the Farrah Fawcett spray.
- Farrah Fawcett spray? - Yeah, Farrah Fawcett.
You tell anyone I just told you that and your ass is grass.
You're dead, Henderson.
Do you understand? Yup.
Okay.
- Farrah Fawcett, really? - I mean, she's hot.
Yeah.
Hey, it's, uh It's me.
I know that I've been gone too long, and, uh It's I just, I want you to know that it's not about you and it's not about our fight.
Okay? Something came up, and I will I will explain it all when I see you.
I just I want you to know that I'm not mad.
I'm just sorry.
About everything.
I I don't want you to get hurt at all.
And I don't wanna lose you.
Just make sure you heat up some real food.
Not just Eggos.
And I want you to eat all the peas, even if they're mushy and gross.
And I will be home soon.
This is him last week.
And there are the hippocampal abnormalities we had discussed.
Nothing out of line with what we've seen from others suffering from post-traumatic stress.
But this is Will from last night.
And as you can see, there are now abnormalities in the limbic and paralimbic areas.
And this is from an hour ago.
I don't hear any suggestions.
We have bigger problems than the boy.
- Do we? - We can't keep delaying the burn.
You're talking about putting putting a Band-Aid on this.
Right now, a Band-Aid is the best option.
It's our only option.
And if it kills the boy? Then quite frankly, Sam, it kills him.
Say that to me again.
The rate this is spreading, he'll be lost by the end of the day.
What we do or don't do won't change the outcome.
We have to start the burn.
Where you going? I'm going to think.
What the hell is taking so long? Hey doctors take forever, always.
Just try and relax.
Just be patient.
You know, I just Let me through.
Let me through! - You know we can't do that.
- I need to talk to - He'll be with you shortly.
- You said that an hour ago.
Will.
Will? Will? What's wrong? Are you hurting again? Uh I saw something.
In your now-memories? The shadow monster.
I think I know how to stop him.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, this will do.
This will do just fine.
Good call, dude.
I said medium-well! Who's that? You told her? - So what? - "So what?" - You wanted to tell her, too.
- But I didn't, all right? We agreed not to tell her and to look for Dart.
Who you conveniently found.
Are you suggesting that I'm lying? I'm saying you have a creepy little bond with him.
Yeah, that was before he turned into a Demogorgon.
- And you haven't heard from Mike? - No.
- Or Will? - No.
- Hopper? - No! No one is around.
Why do you think I'm with Steve Harrington? - Something's - Wrong.
I agree.
Which is why we need as much help as we can get.
She didn't believe me anyway.
You probably didn't tell it right.
That must be it.
So, we good? Hey! Dickheads! How come the only one helping me out is this random girl? We lose light in 40 minutes.
Let's go.
Let's go, I said! - All right, asshole! God! - Okay! Stupid.
What What is all of this? I don't know.
Mom? Will? I don't shoot Polaroid.
- What? - It's not mine.
Someone else has been here.
Sam, this is ludicrous.
- Just give him a moment, okay? - We don't have time Hey, jackass, why don't you do us all a favor and shut up, okay? That's it.
That's what? What what's there, Will? I don't know.
I just know he doesn't want me to see there.
I think it's important.
Let's see if this kid's a wizard or schizo, Doc.
First door on your right, gentlemen.
I'm guessing a ten.
Let's not overdo it now.
I read four.
Moving in.
So you really fought one of these things before? And you're, like, totally, 100% sure it wasn't a bear? Shit.
Don't be an idiot.
Okay? It wasn't a bear.
Why are you even here if you don't believe us? Just go home.
Geesh.
Someone's cranky.
Past your bedtime? That's good.
Just show her you don't care.
I don't.
Why are you winking, Steve? Stop.
- It's kinda awesome.
- Huh? The fog, I mean.
Looks like the ocean.
- You miss it? - What? The ocean.
The waves? California? Hawkins seems pretty lame, I bet.
No, no, no, it's not that.
It's just My dad's still there.
So - Why? - It's this legal term called "divorce.
" See, when two married people don't love each other anymore Yeah.
My mom and my stepdad, they wanted a fresh start away from him.
As if As if he was the problem, which is total bull.
And things are just worse now.
My stepbrother's always been a dick, but now he's just angry all the time and Well, he can't take it out on my mom, so So he takes it out on you? I don't even know why I'm telling you this.
It's just I know that I can be a jerk like him sometimes, and I do not want to be like him.
Ever.
I guess I'm angry, too, and I'm sorry.
Jesus! What's wrong with me? Hey.
You're nothing like your brother, okay? You're cool and different.
And you're super smart.
And you're, like, totally tubular.
- Nobody actually says that, you know.
- Well, I do now.
And it makes you seem really cool.
I like talking with you, Mad Max.
And I like talking with you, stalker.
- You see him? - No.
Lucas, what's going on? Hold on! I've got eyes! Ten o'clock! Ten o'clock! There.
- What's he doing? - I don't know.
- Wait.
You sure that's not a dog? - What? He's not taking the bait.
Why is he not taking the bait? Maybe he's not hungry? Maybe he's sick of cow.
Steve? Steve, what are you doing? Steve? Just get ready.
Come on, buddy.
- What's he doing? - Expanding the menu.
Come on, buddy.
Come on, buddy.
Come on.
Dinner time.
Human tastes better than cat, I promise.
He's insane.
He's awesome.
Steve, watch out! A little busy here! Three o'clock! Three o'clock! Steve! Steve! Abort! Abort! - Steve, run! - Steve, hurry! Steve, run! Shit! Are they rabid or something? They can't get in! They can't! Shit! Is anyone there? Mike? Will? God! Anyone! Shit! We're at the old junkyard, and we are going to die! Out of the way! Out of the way! You want some? Come get this! Jeez.
What happened? I don't know.
- Steve scared 'em off? - No.
No way.
They're going somewhere.
- Almost there, ladies.
- Roger.
All right, stay frosty, boys.
- Wait.
That's where I was.
- What? It's that damn graveyard.
Sir, there's nothing here.
Looks like your kid's full of shit, Doc.
Got some kind of fog moving in now.
I'm sorry.
What? What do you mean, sweetie? He made me do it.
Who? Who made you do what? I told you.
They upset him.
They shouldn't have done that.
They shouldn't have upset him.
The spy.
The spy! We've got movement.
You've got company, fellas.
Whoa, whoa! I need to get through! It's a trap! It's a trap! I need to warn them.
It's a trap! I can't see shit! Where are they? Where are they? They're right on you! - Wait, what? - What was that? Will, sweets, talk to me.

The rainbow room? What did the girl look like? - Different.
- Different than you? I think this is why Mama wanted to talk.
To show you the girl? I think she wants me to find her.
When Terry was looking for you, she kept these files of other missing kids.
Kids she thought were like you.
Maybe that girl is in here somewhere.
Here.
Does anyone look familiar? Is that her? [STATIC CRACKLING] - Did you find her? - [EXHALES] No.
[FIRE CRACKLING] Hello? [GASPS AND PANTS] Becky! Becky, I found her.
[BECKY] I just I didn't know who else to call.
He gave me this number, and he came here looking for her.
I thought maybe he could help me.
Yeah, Jim Hopper, he came here with some woman named Joyce Byers? Well, that's a little hard to explain.
Uh There's another girl, and she's missing, and I think she's in trouble.

[LAUGHING] They're all dead! They're all dead! [LAUGHING] They're all dead! [PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [DOTTIE] You should do stand-up, Axe.
There's a spot a few blocks away.
Hello? Well, well What do we have here? [MICK SCOFFS] What is she wearing? What are those, overalls? [DOTTIE] There aren't any cows to milk here, kid.
Go on back to the farm now.
I'm looking for my sister.
Aw Shirley Temple lost her sister.
So sad.
I saw her.
Here.
Uh-uh.
Hand out of pocket.
Slow.
Give me that shit.
- Is that Kali? - Kali? How did you find us? - Who else knows you're here? - No one.
So, what then? Poof! You just show up like magic with that picture? Stay calm.
She's just a kid.
A kid who could get us all killed.
If I have to ask again, Shirley, you'll start losing things.
Starting with those pretty little locks of yours.
Yeah? Come on, Axe.
Put down the knife.
How did you find us? - I saw her.
- [MICK] Axe! That's not an answer.
Jesus.
Jesus Christ! [EXCLAIMING] Get off! Shit! Shit! [KALI] You're a terrible dancer, Axel.
I told you, stay out of my head.
So, we're threatening little girls now, are we? - She knows about you.
- She had this.
Where did you get this? Mama.
Your mother gave this to you? In her dream circle.
[SCOFFS] Dream circle.
I think she's a schizo or something.
Says she's looking for her sister.
Yeah.
Like I said, schizo.
Jesus! I saw you.
In the rainbow room.
What is your name? Jane.
Sister.
Sister.
[KALI] And this memory your mother shared that is your only memory of me? [ELEVEN] Yes.
[KALI] And how long have you been with this policeman? [ELEVEN] Three hundred and twenty-seven days.
And this policeman, he thinks he can work out some sort of deal with these men to set you free? Yes.
- He says soon.
- He's naÃ¯ve then.
We'll always be monsters to them.
Do you understand? Let me guess.
Your policeman, he also stops you from using your gifts? What you can do is incredible.
It makes you very special, Jane.
Wait.
- Do you have a gift? - Different.
I can make people see, or not see, whatever I choose.
Is that why you made the man with the crazy hair dance? Axel is not so fond of spiders, so You made him see spiders? But it doesn't have to be scary.
This butterfly, it isn't real.
I've just convinced your mind it is.
Think of it as a kind of magic.
Are you real? Yes, I'm real.
[BOTH CHUCKLE] What's wrong? Nothing is wrong.
I just feel whole now.
Like a piece of me was missing, and now it's not.
Does that make sense? Yes.
I think your mother sent you here for a reason.
I think she somehow knew that we belong together.
I think this is your home.
Home.
Yes.
Home.

[ALL] E-I-E-I-O And on his farm he had a cow She found me with only this.
What's that mean? It means she can find people without moving.
With nothing but an image.
You telling me Shirley's a human radar detector or some shit? Or some shit, yes.
Come on.
No way.
We'll find out soon enough.
I want to do one.
Tomorrow.
- You serious, Kal? - We're way too hot right now.
[SING-SONG] Paranoid.
Realistic.
You don't kill their men and expect them to look the other way.
If they find us, they will unleash hell.
So we give in to fear? She's in pain.
She needs this.
We go out tomorrow.
Swear to God, Shirley Temple's gonna get us all killed.
[HOPPER] It's me.
I know that I've been gone too long, and, uh I just want you to know that it's not because of you.

Something came up, and, uh, I'll explain everything soon.
I just, um I want you to know that I'm not I'm not mad at you.

Don't let his size frighten you.
Fun's a teddy bear.
Nice to meet you, Miss Jane.
If you're looking for a number, you won't find one.
They're not like us.
No, not in that way.
But like us, they're outcasts.
Outcasts? - Freaks.
- Speak for yourself.
Society left them behind, hurt them, discarded them.
We were dead, all of us.
Kali saved us.
Here.
And here.
Don't get all mushy on us now, Fun.
No, not mushy.
True.
Now we help her.
In this life, kid, you roll over or you fight back.
We're all fighters here.
Fight who? Everyone you see here was in some way responsible for what happened to us.
You hurt the bad men? No, we just give 'em a pat on the back.
You kill them? They're criminals.
We simply make them pay for their crimes.
Boom.
Damn, Shirley.
What's the matter? You look like you've seen a ghost.
We can't all be fighters, I guess.
I'm a fighter.
I've killed.
These men you killed, did they deserve it? - They hurt me.
- [SCREAMING] And they still want to hurt you.
To hurt us.
We're just making the first move.
Come.
I was just like you once.
I kept my anger inside.
I tried to hide from it, but then that pain festered.
Festered? It spread.
Until finally I confronted my pain, and I began to heal.
- Do you see that train? - Yes.
I want you to draw it to us.
[METAL CREAKING] [ELEVEN] I can't.
Last night you told me you lifted a van once.
Yes.
The bad men were trying to take you again, and that made you angry.
Good.
So, find that anger, focus on that, not the train, not its weight.
I want you to find something from your life.
Something that angers you.
- [MAX LAUGHS] - Now channel it.
Dig deeper.
Your whole life you've been lied to - Do I have a mother? - She's not around anymore.
imprisoned.
Don't walk away from me! Grow the hell up! [SCREAMING] The bad men took away your home, your mother Jane.

Papa! They stole your life, Jane.
I want you to find them.
[SCREAMING] [MICK WHOOPS] Yeah! - [ALL CHEERING] - Yeah, Jane! So, how do you feel? Good.
These are the bad men, as you call them.
The one's we believe are still alive.
Do you know any? Him.
[DR.
BRENNER] Four-fifty He hurt Mama.
His name is Ray Caroll.

Let's do this.
- Keep it running.

[SCREAMS] [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Punky, what's the matter? A nightmare.
I dreamt I was in the doctor's office.
All of a sudden, he's started to give me my shot in my arm.
Then the needle got bigger and bigger and bigger [KNOB CLICKING] [KALI] Hello, Ray.
Jesus Christ! [FUNSHINE] Sit down.
Please.
- I said sit.
- Please Just, please just take what you want.
[AXEL] Oh, we will.

Do you remember us? What about us? Do you remember us, Ray? [GRUNTING] Please.
Please.
You hurt Mama.
- [EXCLAIMS] - [GRUNTS] [GROANS] Wait.
[SHAKILY] Please.
Listen I just did what he told me to do.
He said she was sick.
You had a choice, Ray.
And you chose to follow a man you knew was evil.
No, wait! No, wait! Wait! I can help.
I can help you find him.
- Find who? - Brenner! I can take you to him.
Papa is gone.
No, he is alive.
Do not lie to us, Ray.
I'm not lying! [SOFTLY] I swear [WHIMPERING] He trusts me.
I'll take you to him.
If he's alive, Jane will find him.
Just as she found you.
Do it, Jane.
- Do it.
- Wait.
[CHOKING] Not too quick.
He wasn't so generous with your mother.
[WOMAN OVER PHONE] Sweetie, just stay calm.
[AXEL] Oh, shit! The police are on their way, honey.
Okay? [GASPING, COUGHING] What's wrong? - What's wrong? - We got a problem.
[DOTTIE] Kids in the apartment.
[RAY] Please - Did he show your mother mercy? No.
- [RAY] Please.
No.
I'm sorry.
He took her from you, without hesitation.
Please don't.
Please.
[AXEL] We got to go, K.
They called the cops.
We finish this first.
- [AXEL] Kali! - Jane, now! [RAY] Please, don't Please.
Please.
- [GUN COCKS] - [EXCLAIMS] - [GASPS] - [GLASS SHATTERS] [POLICE SIRENS WAILING] [AXEL] Kali, we gotta go! - [DOTTIE] Shit! - [AXEL] Go, go, go! [DOTTIE] Shit! Come on.
Get in! If you wanted to show mercy, that is your choice.
But don't you ever take away mine.
Ever.
Do you understand? Do you understand? [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] [FUNSHINE] I see you, and I raise you ten.
How ya like that? That was a mistake right there, girl.
A mistake.
[DOTTIE] I think you're full of shit.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR] May I sit? I was once just like you, you know that? But that's why I'm hard on you, because I see in you my past mistakes.
They were kids.
Does that excuse that man's sins? Were we not also children? I remember the day I came to the rainbow room and you were gone.
So, when my gifts were strong enough, I used them to escape.
And I ran.
I ran away as far as I could.
And it was there, far away, that I found a place to hide.
A family.
A home.
Just like you and your policeman.
But they couldn't help me.
So, eventually, I lost them, too.
So, I decided to play the part.
To stop hiding.
To use my gifts against those who hurt us.
You're now faced with the same choice, Jane.
Go back into hiding and hope they don't find you.
Fight, and face them again.
Face who? The man who calls himself our father.
Papa is dead.
[DR.
BRENNER] That man tonight disagreed.
You're not real.
All this time? And you haven't looked for me? Why? Because you thought I was dead? Or because you were afraid of what you might find? Go away.
You have to confront your pain.
You have a wound, Eleven, a terrible wound.
And it's festering.
Do you remember what that means? Festering? It means a rot.
And it will grow.
[ECHOING] Spread.
- Get out of my head.
- And eventually, it will kill you.
[SCREAMING] Get out of my head! [CRYING] This isn't a prison, Jane.
You're always free to return to your policeman.
Or stay, and avenge your mother.
Let us heal our wounds together.
- [LAUGHS] Full house.
- Screw this.
I'm out.
- Out of money, you mean.
You are broke! - [LAUGHING] - You want in, Mick? - [SCOFFS] Nope.
- Aw, come on! Just one hand.
- You're the worst.
[DOTTIE] How am I the worst? Because, one hand leads to two hands, two hands leads to three.
Before you know it, I'm as broke as Axel.
- [DOTTIE] Are you in or out? - [MICK] Out.
Today, tomorrow, the next day.
Maybe we can call you "El.
" Short for Eleven.
You'd better run! She's our friend, and she's crazy! [MIKE] No, El, you're not the monster.
You saved me, you understand? You saved me.
[ELEVEN] Compromise? [HOPPER] It's something that's kind of in between.
Like halfway happy.
Once we fix it up, it's gonna be nice.
Real nice.
This is your new home.
- [GRUNTS] - [BEEPING] [ECHOING] That's where I was.
It's a damn graveyard.
I need to get through! I need to get through! - [HOPPER] Whoa! Whoa! - I need to warn them.
It's a trap! I need to get through.
It's a trap.
I need to tell them it's a trap.
- [ELEVEN] Mike! - It's a trap! It's a trap! Mike! Mike! Mike! Mike! Mike, where are you? Mike! Mike! [LOUD BANGING] [OFFICER] Go, go, go! Let's go.
[OFFICER] Don't move! - [AXEL] The hell's going on? - They found us! - Jesus! Jesus Christ! - No, no, no.
Shh - [OFFICER 1] Spread left.
- [OFFICER 2] Right.
[FUNSHINE] Let's go! Now! - Hey! Hey! - Jane, come on! Come on, hurry! Look out! Look out! [SCREAMING] [OFFICER] Get down! Get down! [AXEL] Do something, Kal.
Do something! Jane, get in.
It's a damn graveyard.
- Mike! - It's a trap! It's a trap! I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but I have to go back.
My friends My friends are in danger.
This isn't time for a talk.
We got to go right now! Your mother sent you here for a reason, remember? We belong together.
There's nothing for you back there.
They cannot save you, Jane.
No.
But I can save them.
Jane.
Jane! Jane! Jane! The hell was that? What's wrong with her? [WOMAN] You all right, sweetie? You were looking a little forlorn there.
You mind if I join you? Hmm.
[SIGHS] You are awfully young to be traveling alone, aren't you? Well, you are quite the chatterbox.
So, where are you headed? To your parents, I hope? I'm going to my friends.
I'm going home.

1 Mother of God.
It's it's polycarbonate.
It can't get through.
Mother Mary and Joseph.
You sure about that glass? What the hell? - We're too late.
- What? We're too late! What's going on? We're under attack.
What's going on down there? Does anybody copy? Hurry! Stairs! Stairs! We need to make Will sleep.
- What? - He's a spy.
If he knows where we are, - so does the shadow monster.
- He's lying! He killed those soldiers.
He'll kill us, too! He's lying! He's lying! He's lying! He's lying! He's lying! Shit! Those are gunshots! He's lying! He's lying! Okay, Will, Will, listen, listen.
Do you know who I am? Do you know who I am? You're You're You're Mom.
Hold him down.
No! No! Let go! No! No! Let me go! Let go! - No, let me go! - I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
- Let me go! Let go! Let me go! No! Let go! Let me go! Let me go! We gotta go.
We gotta go.
Come on! Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Hey, guys, we're home.
Guys? Hello? Max? Billy? Yeah, I'm a little bit busy in here, Susan.
Open the door.
Right now.
What's wrong? Why don't you tell us? Because I don't know.
- We can't find Maxine.
- And her window's open.
- Where is she? - I don't know.
You don't know? Look, I'm sure she just, I don't know, went to the arcade or something.
I'm sure she's fine.
You were supposed to watch her.
I know, Dad.
I was.
It's just you guys were three hours late, and, well, I have a date.
I'm sorry, okay? That's why you've been staring at yourself in the mirror like some faggot instead of watching your sister? I have been looking after her all week, Dad.
Okay? She wants to run off, then that's her problem, all right? She's 13 years old.
She shouldn't need a full-time babysitter.
And she's not my sister! What did we talk about? What did we talk about? Respect and responsibility.
That is right.
Now, apologize to Susan.
I'm sorry, Susan.
It's okay, Neil, really No, it's not okay.
Nothing about his behavior is okay.
But he's gonna make up for it.
He's gonna call whatever whore he's seeing tonight and cancel their date.
And then he's gonna go find his sister.
Like the good, kind, respecting brother that he is.
Isn't that right, Billy? Isn't that right? Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
Yes, sir.
Find Max.
You're positive that was Dart? Yes.
He had the same exact yellow pattern on his butt.
- He was tiny two days ago.
- Well, he's molted three times already.
- Malted? - Molted.
Shed his skin to make room for growth like hornworms.
- When's he gonna molt again? - It's gotta be soon.
When he does, he'll be fully grown, or close to it.
And so will his friends.
Yeah, and he's gonna eat a lot more than just cats.
Wait, a cat? - Dart ate a cat? - No, what? No.
What are you talking about? He ate Mews.
Mews? Who's Mews? - It's Dustin's cat.
- Steve! I knew it! You kept him! No! No.
No, I No, I He missed me.
He wanted to come home.
Bullshit! I didn't know he was a Demogorgon, - Okay? - Oh, so now you admit it? Guys, who cares? We have to go.
I care! You put the party in jeopardy! You broke the rule of law! - So did you! - What? You told a stranger the truth! A stranger? You wanted to tell her, too! But I didn't, Lucas, okay? I didn't tell her! We both broke the rule of law, okay? So we're even.
We're even.
No, no! We're not even.
Don't even try that.
Your stupid pet could have ate us for dinner! - That was not my fault! - Guys? He wasn't gonna eat us.
He was crawling to come say hello? Guys! No, no, no.
Hey, guys, why are you headed towards the sound? Hello? Hello? I don't see him.
It's the lab.
They were going back home.
Look, this is us, and this is the nearest exit.
But even if we somehow make it there, there's no way out.
- What do you mean? - The locks are fail secure.
Fail secure? If there's a power outage, the building goes on lockdown.
Can it be unlocked remotely? With a computer, sure, but somebody's gotta reset the breakers.
- Where are the breakers? - Breakers are in the basement, three floors down.
Hey, where are you going? To reset the breakers.
Okay, then what? - Then we get out of here.
- No, then the power comes back on.
If you wanna unlock the doors, you have to reboot the computer system, and then override the security codes with a manual input.
Fine, how do I do that? You can't.
Not unless you know BASIC.
I don't know what that means.
- It's a computer programming language.
- Teach it to me.
Shall I teach you French while I'm at it, Jim? How about a little German? How about you, Doc? You speak BASIC? No.
Okay, I got this.
I got this.
No.
Bob.
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.
Remember, Bob Newby, superhero.
Okay, grab his walkie.
All right, you know how to use one of these? No.
Safety on.
Safety off.
Point.
Squeeze.
Point and squeeze.
Okay.
Easy-peasy.
If anything happens down there, I want you to come right back up.
Right back here.
Listen.
Don't wait for me.
As soon as I get those doors open - I'm gonna get them out.
- Yeah? I promise.
Okay, well I'll be in touch.
Why are the lights off? Maybe it's closed? Security took the night off? I don't think so.
It's not working? No! The power's off.
- Jonathan? - What? I think there's something in the woods.
Nancy, stay back.
Hello? Who's there? Who's there? Steve? - Nancy? - Jonathan.
What are you doing here? What are you doing here? We're looking for Mike and Will.
- They're not in there, are they? - We're not sure.
Why? Keep it together, Bob.
Oh, God.
Okay, here we go.
He made it.
- We haven't seen Will - I haven't seen him since The power's back.
- Let me try.
- Hang on Let me try, Jonathan! Son of a bitch! You know what Okay, Bob, can you hear us? Loud and clear, Doc.
Can you hear me back? We hear you.
All right, give me a minute.
Open sesame.
It's open.
Okay.
Hey! I got it! I got it! Easy-peasy.
Son of a bitch did it.
Right, I'll meet you outside.
Nice job.
- Hold on a second, Chief.
- What's wrong? West stairwell's not clear anymore.
- What's going on? - We've got some company.
- Where? - The west stairwell.
I got an idea.
What the hell's he doing? Okay.
And splash.
Okay.
Okay, that worked.
Now, get out of there.
Go! Go! Wait a second, Chief? - What? - Take this.
What are you doing? Any more surprises, I'll let you know.
Go.
Go! Come on, Bob.
Come on.
Hey, Bob? Yeah? - I'm gonna guide you, okay? - Is there a problem? No, it's just It's, uh, getting a little crowded up here, so we're gonna have to take this slow.
Okay.
All right, just start walking.
Okay, good.
Okay, now, your next right.
Now, keep going, keep going, keep going Stop! What? What? Bob, there's a door on your left, do you see that? Yeah? - That's a closet.
- Okay? - Yeah, I need you to get in it.
- What? Now! Right now.
Get in the closet.
Jesus Christ.
Okay.
How you holding up there, Bob? You all right? Yeah.
Yeah.
You got a pretty clear shot to the front door.
Okay.
You can do this, okay? You're almost home free, all right, Bob? Run! Bob! Bob.
No! No! Go! No! Go! Bob! Bob! No! - What happened? - No! No! He's gone! He's gone! Come on! Get in! Guys? Let's go.
Come on! Come on, let's go! Let's go! Come on! I'm sorry, bud.
Sorry I wasn't there.
I should have been here.
Sam Owens.
Dr.
Sam Owens.
How many people at the lab? I don't know how many people are there! I don't know how many people are left alive! Have you contacted the police? I am the police! Chief Jim Hopper! Is there a number I can reach you at? Yes, the number that I gave you, yes.
- Okay, yes, I got it.
- 6767 - I will be here.
- I'll have them contact you.
They didn't believe you, did they? We'll see.
"We'll see"? We can't just sit here while those things are loose! We stay here, and we wait for help.
Did you guys know that Bob was the original founder of Hawkins AV? Really? He petitioned the school to start it and everything.
Then he had a fund-raiser for equipment.
Mr.
Clarke learned everything from him.
Pretty awesome, right? Yeah.
We can't let him die in vain.
What do you want to do, Mike? The Chief's right on this.
We can't stop those Demo-dogs on our own.
Demo-dogs? Demogorgon dogs.
Demo-dogs.
It's like a compound.
It's like a play on words Okay.
I mean, when it was just Dart, maybe But there's an army now.
- Precisely.
- His army.
What do you mean? His army.
Maybe if we stop him, we can stop his army, too.
The shadow monster.
It got Will that day on the field.
The doctor said it was like a virus, it infected him.
And so this virus, it's connecting him to the tunnels? To the tunnels, monsters, the Upside Down, everything.
Whoa.
Slow down.
Slow down.
Okay, so, the shadow monster's inside everything.
And if the vines feel something like pain, then so does Will.
- And so does Dart.
- Yeah.
Like what Mr.
Clarke taught us.
- The hive mind.
- Hive mind? A collective consciousness.
It's a super-organism.
And this is the thing that controls everything.
It's the brain.
Like the mind flayer.
- The what? - What? The mind flayer.
What the hell is that? It's a monster from an unknown dimension.
It's so ancient that it doesn't even know its true home.
Okay, it enslaves races of other dimensions by taking over their brains using its highly-developed psionic powers.
Oh, my God, none of this is real.
This is a kids' game.
No, it's a manual.
And it's not for kids.
And unless you know something that we don't, this is the best metaphor Analogy.
Analogy? That's what you're worried about? Fine.
An analogy for understanding whatever the hell this is.
Okay, so this mind flamer thing Flayer.
Mind flayer.
What does it want? To conquer us, basically.
It believes it's the master race.
Like the Germans? Uh, the Nazis? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Nazis.
- Uh If the Nazis were from another dimension, totally.
Uh, it views other races, like us, as inferior to itself.
It wants to spread, take over other dimensions.
We are talking about the destruction of our world as we know it.
That's great.
That's great.
That's really great.
Jesus! Okay, so if this thing is like a brain that's controlling everything, then if we kill it We kill everything it controls.
- We win.
- Theoretically.
Great.
So how do you kill this thing? Shoot it with Fireballs or something? No.
No, no Fire No Fireballs.
Uh, you summon an undead army, uh, because because zombies, you know, they don't have brains, and the mind flayer, it it It likes brains.
- It's just a game.
It's a game.
- What the hell are we doing here? I thought we were waiting for your military backup.
We are! How are they gonna stop this? You can't just shoot this with guns.
You don't know that! We don't know anything! We know it's already killed everybody in that lab.
We know the monsters are gonna molt again.
We know that it's only a matter of time before those tunnels reach this town.
They're right.
We have to kill it.
I want to kill it.
Me, too.
- I - Me, too, Joyce, okay? But how do we do that? We don't exactly know what we're dealing with here.
No.
But he does.
If anyone knows how to destroy this thing, it's Will.
He's connected to it.
He'll know its weakness.
I thought we couldn't trust him anymore.
That he's a spy for the mind flayer now.
Yeah, but he can't spy if he doesn't know where he is.
Yeah, this'll work.
Hey.
What you did, um, helping the kids that was really cool.
Yeah.
Those little shits are real trouble, you know? Believe me, I know.
Hey.
I'm I'm sorry about Dart and all.
I guess I just thought that he was my friend.
I was wrong.
I broke the rule of law, so if you want your girlfriend to to take over my spot in the party, I understand.
She's not my girlfriend.
I saw you two holding hands in the bus, Lucas.
She was just scared.
Maybe, but I could feel it.
Feel what? The electricity.
I get why El was your mage now.
What? Lucas.
He told me all about her.
Well, he shouldn't have.
And just because you know the truth, it doesn't mean you're in our party.
You do know that, right? Yeah, I know.
I mean, why would you want a stupid zoomer in your party anyway? I'm just saying, El? She sounds like she was really awesome.
Yeah, she was.
Until that thing took her.
Just like it took Bob.
You sure this is gonna work? He knew who I was.
He's still in there.
It's gonna work.
It has to.
- All right, you ready? - Yeah.
If he finds out where we are will he send those dogs after us? He won't find out.
Yeah, but, if he does Judgment day.
What? What? What is this? What? What is this? Why am I tied up? Will, we just wanna talk to you.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Where am I? You recognize this? Do you recognize this? Hey.
We wanna help you.
But to do that, we have to understand how to kill it.
Why am I tied up? Why am I tied up? Why am I tied up? Why am I tied up? Hey.
Why am I tied up? Why am I tied up? Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go Go Go Do you know what March 22nd is? It's your birthday.
Your birthday.
When you turned eight, I gave you that huge box of crayons.
Do you remember that? It was 120 colors.
And all your friends, they got you Star Wars toys, but all you wanted to do was draw with all your new colors.
And you drew this big spaceship, but it wasnât from a movie.
It was your spaceship.
A rainbow ship is what you called it.
And you must have used every color in the box.
I took that with me to Melvald's and I put it up and I told everyone who came in, "My son drew this.
" And you were so embarrassed.
But I was so proud.
I was so, so proud.
Do you remember the day Dad left? We stayed up all night building Castle Byers just the way you drew it.
And it took so long because you were so bad at hammering.
You'd miss the nail every time.
And then it started raining, but we stayed out there anyway.
We were both sick for like a week after that.
But we just had to finish it, didn't we? We just had to.
Do you remember the first day that we met? It was It was the first day of kindergarten.
I knew nobody.
I had no friends and I just felt so alone and so scared, but I saw you on the swings and you were alone, too.
You were just swinging by yourself.
And I just walked up to you and I asked.
I asked if you wanted to be my friend.
And you said yes.
You said yes.
It was the best thing I've ever done.
Will, baby if you're in there, just please please talk to us.
Please, honey, please, can you do that for me? Please.
I love you so much.
Let me go.
What happened? I think he's talking, just not with words.
What is that? Morse code.
H-E-R-E.
Here.
Will's still in there.
He's talking to us.
Do you remember the first time I played you this? Mom and Dad were both arguing in the next room.
So I played you the mix tape I made you.
And it was the first time you got into music.
Real music.
Dash, dot, dash, dot.
- Yeah, got it.
- C.
And then the party escaped into the sewers, and there were those big insect things, and you guys were still on level one.
L.
O.
Then you cast Fog Cloud and you saved us.
You saved the whole party.
S.
You saw that little girl and she was in the sandbox and she was crying.
E.
You gave him your Tonka Truck and I told you we couldn't afford to buy another one.
G.
You said she should have it because she's sad.
"She's sad, Mommy.
" A.
- I love you so much.
- T.
So, so much.
E.
"Close gate.
" Shit.
Shit.
Do you think he heard that? It's just a phone.
It could be anywhere.
Right? Hey.
Hey, can you hear me? It knows.
It knows where we are.
Oh, shit.
That's not good.
- They're coming! - What? - Come on.
We gotta go.
- Come on.
- We gotta go.
- Okay.
Come on, come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Hey.
Hey, get away from the windows! - Do you know how to use this? - What? Can you use this? I can.
Where are they? What are they doing? Holy shit.
Is it dead? 
----------
1 Eleven.
Mike.
[GASPS] Is that I never gave up on you.
I called you every night.
Every night for 353 days.
I heard.
Why didn't you tell me you were there? - That you were okay? - [HOPPER] Because I wouldn't let her.
- The hell is this? Where you been? - Where have you been? You've been hiding her.
- You've been hiding her this whole time! - Hey! Let's talk.
Alone.
- Protecting her! Protecting her? - Listen.
Listen to me.
The more people know about her, the more danger she's in.
And the more danger you and your family are in So I should be thanking you? I'm not asking you to thank me! I'm asking you to try to understand.
I don't! I don't understand! That's fine.
That's fine! Just do not blame her! All right? She's upset enough as it is.
I don't blame her! I blame you! I blame you! That's okay, kid.
That's okay.
No! Nothing about this is okay! - Nothing about this is okay! - Oh, jeez You're a stupid, disgusting, - lying piece of shit! - Okay.
All right! Stop it.
- Liar! Liar! Liar! - Stop it.
It's okay.
- Stop it! Stop it! - [CRYING] Liar! Liar! You're okay, kid.
You're okay.
I'm sorry, kid.
- [LUCAS] We missed you.
- I missed you, too.
[DUSTIN] We talked about you pretty much every day.
Teeth.
- What? - You have teeth.
Oh.
You like these pearls? [PURRS] [MAX] Eleven? Hey.
Um, I'm Max.
I've heard a lot about you.
- [SIGHS] Hey.
Hey, sweetheart.
- [CRIES] [SNIFFLES] Hey.
Can I see him? [SIGHS] He's not doing well.
I know.
I saw.
What else did you see? You opened this gate before, right? Yes.
Do you think if we got you back there, that you could close it? [ROARS AND SCREECHES] [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] Memories Light the corners of my mind [DOORBELL RINGS] Misty water-colored memories - [DOORBELL RINGS] - Of the way we were Ted! Would you please get that? [SNORING] [DOORBELL CONTINUES RINGING] - [DOORBELL CONTINUES RINGING] - Ted! Of the smiles we left behind [DOORBELL RINGING RAPIDLY] Hold on, please.
- Oh.
Hi.
- Hi.
I, uh, didn't realize Nancy had a sister.
[CHUCKLES] What's so funny? I'm Nancy's mother.
- No.
- Yes.
[CHUCKLES] Mrs.
Wheeler.
[STAMMERS] Um, I'm sorry, and you are? Billy.
Billy Hargrove.
You must be here for Nancy.
Nancy? No, no, no.
Not my type.
Uh No, actually, I am looking for my little sister Max.
Goes by Maxine.
She's been missing all day, and, uh, to be honest with you, - I've been worried sick, you know, so - Oh.
I thought she was at Lucas', but Mrs.
Sinclair said your house is the the designated hangout, so, you know Here I am.
Their driveway is pretty dark this time of night.
So drive slowly.
Always.
And when you see Mike, tell him to come home already, okay? You're a real lifesaver, you know that? Anytime.
I'll see you later.
Do believe that I'm falling in love Hmm.
Do believe that I'm falling in love Do believe it Do believe that I'm falling in love [HOPPER SIGHS] It's not like it was before.
It's grown.
A lot.
And, I mean, that's considering we can get in there.
The place is crawling with those dogs.
Demo-dogs.
- [SIGHS] I'm sorry, what? - I said, uh, Demo-dogs.
Like Demogorgon and dogs.
You put them together, it sounds pretty badass How is this important right now? It's not.
I'm sorry.
I can do it.
You're not hearing me.
I'm hearing you.
I can do it.
Even if El can, there's still another problem.
- If the brain dies, the body dies.
- I thought that was the whole point.
It is, but if we're really right about this I mean, if El closes the gate and kills the mind flayer's army Will's a part of that army.
Closing the gate will kill him.
- [JOYCE] He likes it cold.
- [HOPPER] What? It's what Will kept saying to me.
He likes it cold.
We keep giving it what it wants.
If this is a virus, and Will's the host, then Then we need to make the host uninhabitable.
[NANCY] So if he likes it cold We need to burn it out of him.
We have to do it somewhere he doesn't know this time.
Yeah, somewhere far away.
Take Denfield, then you'll see a large oak tree.
You're gonna swing a right.
That road is gonna dead-end.
And it's about a five-minute walk from there.
[PANTING] Okay.
Denfield to oak tree.
Swing a right.
That's it.
But it's channel ten, right? It's channel ten.
Listen You let me know when that thing is out of him.
You should go with him.
- What? - With Jonathan.
No, I'm [SCOFFS] I'm not just gonna leave Mike.
No one's leaving anyone.
I may be a pretty shitty boyfriend, but turns out I'm actually a pretty damn good babysitter.
Steve It's okay, Nance.
It's okay.
I Just be careful, okay? I can't lose you again.
You won't lose me.
Do you promise? Promise.
El Come on, let's go.
It's time.
[SIGHS DEEPLY] Okay.
[ENGINE STARTS] So, what, we're just not gonna talk about it, huh? About what? Oh, I don't know.
I'm just curious, you know, why all of a sudden you look like some kind of MTV punk.
I'm not mad, kid.
I just want to know where you've been.
That's all.
To see Mama.
Okay.
- How'd you get there? - A truck.
A truck? A big truck.
A big truck? Whose truck was it? - A man's.
- A man's? A nice man.
Okay.
So let me just get this straight in my head.
So a nice man in a big truck, he drove you to your mama's, and then what? Your Aunt Becky gave you those clothes and that makeup? I I shouldn't have left.
Mmm-mmm.
No.
No, this isn't on you, kid.
I should've been there.
I should never have lied to you about your mom.
Or about when you could leave.
A lot of things I shouldn't have done.
Sometimes I feel like I'm [INHALES SHARPLY] Like I'm just some kind of black hole or something.
[SIGHS] A black hole? Yeah, it's a You know, it's this thing in outer space.
It's like, it sucks everything towards it and destroys it.
Sarah had a picture book about outer space.
She loved it.
Who's Sarah? Sarah? Sarah's my girl.
She's my little girl.
Where is she? Well, that's kind of the thing, kid.
She, uh She left us.
- Gone.
- Yeah.
The black hole.
It got her.
And somehow I've just been scared, you know? I've just been scared that it would take you, too.
I think that's why I get so mad.
I'm so sorry.
For everything.
I could be so so Stupid? [CHUCKLING] Yeah.
Stupid.
- [CHUCKLES] - Just really stupid.
I've been stupid, too.
I guess we broke our rule.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY] I don't hate it, by the way.
This whole look.
It's kinda cool.
Bitchin'.
Okay.
Sure.
- Bitchin'.
- [CHUCKLES AND SNIFFLES] [MONSTER ROARING IN DISTANCE] All right.
[SIGHS] It should fit now.
Is this really necessary? Yes, it is, okay? This is a ground-breaking scientific discovery.
We can't just bury it like some common mammal, okay? It's not a dog.
All right, all right, all right.
But you're explaining this to Mrs.
Byers, all right? Christ.
Help me out.
- What am I supposed to do? - Get the door, man.
All right, I got the door.
- Ew.
Jesus - God [PANTING] Phew! Mike, would you just stop already? You weren't in there, okay, Lucas? That lab is swarming with hundreds of those dogs.
Demo-dogs! - [LUCAS] The chief will take care of her.
Like she needs protection.
Listen, dude, a coach calls a play in a game, bottom line, you execute it.
All right? Okay, first of all, this isn't some stupid sports game.
And second, we're not even in the game.
We're on the bench.
[STAMMERS] So my point is Right, yeah, we're on the bench, so, uh, there's nothing we can do.
That's not entirely true.
I mean, these Demo-dogs, they have a hive mind.
When they ran away from the bus, they were called away.
- If we get their attention - Maybe we can draw them from the lab.
Clear a path to the gate.
Yeah, and then we all die.
That's one point of view.
No, that's not a point of view, man.
That's a fact.
I got it! This is where the chief dug his hole.
This is our way into the tunnel.
So Here, right here.
This is like a hub.
So you got all the tunnels feeding in here.
Maybe if we set this on fire Oh, yeah? That's a no.
- The mind flayer would call away his army.
- They'd all come to stop us.
- We circle back to the exit.
- Guys.
- By the time they realize we're gone - El would be at the gate.
Hey.
Hey! Hey! This is not happening.
- But - No, no, no, no, no.
No buts.
I promised I'd keep you shitheads safe, and that's exactly what I plan on.
We're staying here.
On the bench.
And we're waiting for the starting team to do their job.
Does everybody understand? This isn't a stupid sports game.
I said does everybody understand that? I need a yes.
[ENGINE REVVING] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR RADIO] [MAX] It's my brother.
He can't know I'm here.
He'll kill me.
He'll kill us.
[TIRES SCREECH] [MUSIC STOPS PLAYING] Am I dreaming, or is that you, Harrington? Yeah, it's me.
Don't cream your pants.
- [CAR DOOR SLAMS] - What are you doing here, amigo? I could ask you the same thing.
Amigo.
Looking for my stepsister.
A little birdie told me she was here.
Huh, that's weird.
I don't know her.
Small? Redhead? Bit of a bitch.
Doesn't ring a bell.
Sorry, buddy.
[SIGHS] You know, I don't know, this [CLICKS TONGUE] This whole situation, Harrington, I don't know.
It's giving me the heebie-jeebies.
Oh, yeah? Why's that? My 13-year-old sister goes missing all day.
And then I find her with you in a stranger's house.
And you lie to me about it.
[CHUCKLES] Man, were you dropped too much as a child, or what? I don't know what you don't understand about what I just said.
She's not here.
Then who is that? [EXCLAIMS] Shit! Did he see us? Oh, shit.

You stay away from her.
Stay away from her! You hear me? - I said get off me! - [GROANS] So dead, Sinclair! You're dead.

I made myself clear.
Hey, there's no chance we're going to that hole, all right? This ends right now! [DUSTIN] Steve, you're upset, I get it.
But the bottom line is, a party member requires assistance, and it is our duty to provide that assistance.
Now, I know you promised Nance that you would keep us safe.
So, keep us safe.
[SIGHS] [STEVE GRUNTS] Holy shit.
[MIKE] Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's this way.

One where she's not poked and prodded and treated like some kind of lab rat, you know? I don't know, just a thought.

[HOPPER PANTING] [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [REPORTER] Since the release of the incendiary tape, the once quiet town of Hawkins, Indiana, has spent time in a place it never expected.
The national spotlight.
[CHUCKLES] [REPORTER] Under mounting pressure, several high-ranking members from the U.
S.
Department of Energy have admitted involvement in the death and cover-up of Hawkins resident Barbara Holland who died due to exposure to an experimental chemical asphyxiant, which had leaked from the grounds of the lab.
We sent our own April Kline to Hawkins to speak to residents, residents who told us they thought they lived in a safe town.
The kind of town where, they say, nothing ever happens.
Chief-o.
- How's the leg? - Better.
Pretty sure my football career is over.
[BOTH CHUCKLE LIGHTLY] Want some? No way I'm gonna finish it.
No.
I'm, uh on a diet.
Well, you're a better man than me.
- Hey, got a little something for you.
- [HOPPER SIGHS] I thought Sometimes I impress even myself.
Still, I'd let things cool off for a while, if I were you.
How long is a while? [SNIFFLES] Want to be safe? I give it a year.
A year? What about one night out? One night? Yeah.

Thank you.
[WIND WHISTLING] [DOOR BELL JINGLES] - Hey.
- Hey.
You busy? You're our first customer, so [SCOFFS] What now? And then El, she just slams the door.
Right in my face.
Uh-huh? You know, it is that smug son of a bitch, Mike.
He's corrupting her, I'm telling you.
And I'm just gonna lose it.
I mean, I am gonna lose it, Joyce.
Just take it down, Hopper.
I need for them to break up.
That is not your decision.
They're spending entirely too much time together.
You agree with me about that, right? Well, I mean, they're just kissing, right? Yeah, but it is constant.
It is constant.
Okay? That is not normal, that is not healthy.
You can't just force them apart.
I mean, they're not little kids anymore, Hop.
They're teenagers.
If you order them around like a cop, then they're gonna rebel.
It's just what they do.
So what, I'm just supposed to let them do whatever they want? No, I didn't say that.
I think you should talk to them.
No.
No.
'Cause talking doesn't work.
Not yelling.
Not ordering.
But talk to them.
You know, like a heart-to-heart.
A heart-to-heart? What is that? You sit them down and you talk to them, like you're their friend.
I find if you talk to them like you're on their level, then they really start to listen.
And then, you know, you could start to create some boundaries.
- Boundaries.
- Yeah, but, Hop, it's really important that no matter how they respond, you stay calm.
You cannot lose your temper.
Uh Maybe you could do it for me? No.
Yeah, you could.
Yeah, you could.
You come over after work.
- Yes.
- No.
It only works if it comes from you.
But - But? - Maybe I can help you find the right words.
["WORKIN' FOR A LIVIN'" PLAYING] Ooh, whoa! Some days won't end ever and some days pass on by I'll be workin' here forever - Thanks, hon.

[MEN LAUGHING] What about Starcourt? I I was just thinking I mean, I know everyone loves the mall, but how many small businesses have closed since it opened? Like, five on Main, at least.
It's changing the fabric of our town - in a way - "The Death of Small-Town America".
I like it.
I like it a lot.
But I think I've got something even spicier.
It's about the missing mustard on my hamburger.
[MEN LAUGHING] You think you can follow the clues and solve the case of the missing condiment, Nancy Drew? Sorry.
Look out, Phil, she might be after your job! Ow, ow, ow.

I am telling you, it is totally blowing my best feature.
Yeah, company policy is a real drag.

Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Okay Uh I'm going in.

Oh, shit.
She doesn't have electricity? Oh, that's the Amish.

And you didn't yell at him? I'll tell you everything over dinner.
I was thinking, you know, Enzo's, tonight, 7:00.

This is not a date.

Look, I just I just don't know if this is such a good idea anymore.
Really? Because I feel like it's the best idea I've had all summer.
Look, all I'm saying is, what harm is there in asking? The harm in asking is that Tom will say no.
We ask for forgiveness, not permission.
And if this story's as good as I think it's gonna be, then Tom won't care.
In fact, he'll thank us.
Or the old lady is nuts and the story blows up in our face and Tom fires us.
And then we never have to work at this shithole again.

He's crazy.

Hey, guys, I'm almost set up here.

You're gonna treat him like garbage.

Liz, will you get my back? I've done it again I've let you in To tear my heart in two Hey, Jill, I gotta use the restroom.
Will you watch Holly for me? - Sure thing, hon.
- Thanks.
Billy? Billy? I [SIGHS] I understand if you're angry with me.
I just I wanted to explain [BILLY EXHALES SHARPLY] [ECHOING] why I didn't come last night.
[BILLY MURMURS] It's not you, it's just I have a family.
[HEARTBEAT POUNDING] And I can't do anything that will hurt them.
You can understand that, right? - But I shouldn't have said that - [GRUNTS] [KAREN'S VOICE ECHOES] Billy.
[BREATHING RAPIDLY] Billy Please, will you talk to me? Stay away from me, Karen.

Can I try the peppermint stick? Haven't you already tried the peppermint stick? Yes, and I'd like to try it again.
Steve! [MALE VOICE SPEAKING RUSSIAN ON RECORDING] [WALTZ TUNE PLAYS IN BACKGROUND OF RECORDING] So what do you think? - It sounded familiar.
- What? The music.
The music right there at the end.
Why are you listening to the music, Steve? Listen to the Russian! - We're translating Russian! - I'm trying to listen to the Russian, - but there's music - All right, babysitting time is over.
You need to get in there.
Hey, my board.
That was important data, shitbirds.
I guarantee you, what we're doing is way more important than your data.
Yeah? And how do you know these Russians are up to no good anyways? - How does she know about the Russians? - I don't know.
- You told her about - It wasn't me.
Hello, I can hear you.
Actually, I can hear everything.
You are both extremely loud.
You think you have evil Russians plotting against our country, on tape, and you're trying to translate, but haven't figured out a word because you didn't realize Russians use an entirely different alphabet than you do.
Sound about right? - Whoa! What do you think you're doing? - I wanna hear it.
- [BOTH] Why? - 'Cause maybe I can help.
- I'm fluent in four languages, you know.
- Russian? Ou-yay are-yay umb-day.
[LAUGHS] Oh-ho-ho! Holy shit! That was Pig Latin, dingus.
- Idiot.
- But I can speak Spanish and French and Italian, and I've been in band for 12 years.
- My ears are little geniuses, trust me.
- Uh Come on, it's your turn to sling ice cream, my turn to translate.
I don't even want credit.
I'm just bored.
[BELL DINGS AT COUNTER] [LIGHT JAZZ PLAYING] Yes? - Mrs.
Driscoll? - Yes? Hi, um, I'm Nancy.
Nancy Wheeler.
We spoke briefly on the phone last night.
We're from The Hawkins Post.
Oh! Oh, yes! Oh, my goodness.
Oh.
You look too young for reporters.
- We get that a lot.
- [MRS.
DRISCOLL CHUCKLES] Follow me.
[NANCY] Oh, it's it's lovely.
Um, do you live here all alone? Yes.
Jack, my husband, he passed away, what is it now, ten years ago.
Oh, um I'm I'm so sorry.
Oh, don't be.
I kinda like the quiet.
At least, I did.
[DOOR HINGE CREAKS] This way.
[STEPS CREAKING] It's right over there.
[MRS.
DRISCOLL] You see those little teeth marks, don't ya? And these bags, um you're sure they were full before? I'm old, honey, not senile.
Bought them over at Blackburn's Supplies just last Tuesday.
Now you tell me, why would rats want to eat a poor old woman's fertilizer? Are you sure they did? Maybe they just gnawed the bag? I mean eating fertilizer seems Crazy.
Believe me, I know, honey.
But [SIGHS] something's not right with these rats.
What does that mean, exactly "not right"? Rabies, my guess.
That's when I said to myself, "Doris, you gotta call the paper.
" Because if those diseased rats are runnin' loose, the people, they oughta know.
" Wouldn't you agree? [CRASHING SOUND] Oh, yes, I forgot to mention! Come on over here.
- [THUD] - [LOUD SQUEAL] I caught one of the little bastards.
[MONSTROUS CHITTERING] [SQUEALING, SNARLING] [CROWD CHANTING] Kline's a swine! Kline's a swine! Kline's a swine! Kline's a swine! Kline's a swine!

Great.
Thank you.
Jim.
[CHUCKLES] Thanks for coming by.
I'm not doing it, Larry.
[LAUGHS] Calm down, now.
You don't even know what I want.
You don't like your fan club, you want me to shut 'em down.
Sound about right? [LAUGHS] When'd you get so serious? Take a seat.
- [PROTESTERS CHEERING] - [PROTESTER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [CLEARS THROAT DRAMATICALLY] [GRUNTS] My fan club, as you call them, now, you know why they're out there, don't ya? They're not actually fans? [CHUCKLES] They lost their jobs to the mall and blame me for helping make that happen.
Now, you go ask anyone else in this town.
They all love the mall.
It's helped our economy grow, brought in new jobs, and just some incredible new stores.
Which is why they all stopped shopping at their, uh, mom-and-pops.
Now, that's not me, Jim.
- Mm-hmm? - Uh-uh.
That's just, uh, good old fashioned American capitalism.
Well, Larry, I think that they're just exercising their good old fashioned American right to protest.
- [GRUNTS] - I agree.
- Yeah.
- If.
If they had a permit.
Now, correct me if I'm wrong here, Jim, but, uh I don't believe they secured a permit from your office, did they? Not that I'm aware of.
Then I do believe it's within my right to get rid of them.
Larry, I'm not a politics guy, but I think if you force those people out of here without provocation, I don't think that's a good look for your re-election campaign.
["AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL" PLAYING] You know what's in four days, Jim? Independence Day? That's right.
And I'm gonna throw this town the biggest bash it's ever seen.
Fireworks, music, activities, you name it.
I'm gonna pull out all the stops.
You know why? 'Cause at the end of the day, that's all the voters will remember.
But I can't think, much less plan, with all that racket going on out there.
So, if you don't mind, please just do your job.
Flash your little gold badge, and get rid of them.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER] So, what do you think? Hey, what's wrong? Too many people.
Against the rules.
Seriously? You have superpowers.
What's the worst that could happen? [UPBEAT SYNTH MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] So, what should we do first? [LAUGHS] You've never been shopping before, have you? Well, then I guess we're just gonna have to try everything.
Ooh.
Come on.
I just I don't understand what we're looking for.
Something pretty and shiny that says "I'm sorry".
What, just something that literally says "I'm sorry"? No! [CASH REGISTER BEEPING] Do you like that? How do I know what I like? You just try things on.
Until you find something that feels like you.
Like me? Yeah.
Not Hopper.
Not Mike.
You.

That's why we're here, actually.
Yeah, we're shopping.
Not for us, but for her, for Nana.
- For Nana.
- Also, we're here to get a gift for you.
Just, we couldn't find anything that suited you and I only have, like, $3.
50, so it's hard.
Super hard.

[HOPPER LAUGHS] That the right one? [CHUCKLES] Yeah.
Yeah! That's a lot of color for you, Chief.
It's cutting-edge stuff, all right? - It's cutting-edge! - [CHAMBER MUSIC PLAYING] [CAR DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] [CAR ENGINE STARTS] I'll start off with a Scotch, you can make that a double.
Very good, sir.
And I think we'll have a bottle of red, as well.
Very good, sir.
And how's your "chee-anti"? - Our Chianti is quite good.
- Chianti.
Medium-bodied, with just a hint of cherry.
Great.
Women love cherries, huh? All right, we'll have that and two two glasses, please, one for, uh, me and one for the lady.
[WAITER] Ooh.
Very good, sir.
[CRICKETS CHIRPING] [JOYCE] And what is this again? This is a solenoid.
It's a coil, wrapped around a metallic core, and when electricity passes through it It creates an electromagnetic field.
Exactamundo.
Now for the fun part.
- Shall we? - Yeah.
[ELECTRIC HUM] I I don't see anything.
Nope.
You can't see it, but it's there, I assure you.
Our very own Clarke-Byers Electromagnetic Field.
Pretty neato, huh? Yeah.
And this field affects any charged object in its vicinity.
- Just like my magnets.
- Just like your magnets.
Okay, why is nothing happening? Oh, because our field is stable.
But, if we reduce the current How The magnetic dipoles tried to orient according to the field, but No, no, no, I mean, how is this happening at my house? You want my honest opinion? One of your kiddos got up in the middle of the night, bumped into the fridge, and knocked the suckers loose.
And the magnets at Melvald's? - Apophenia.
- Apo-what-o-whah? Apophenia.
Uh You're seeing patterns that aren't there.
Coincidence.
But what if it's not? Well Theoretically-speaking, I suppose some large version of this AC transformer could exist.
A machine of some kind.
A machine? But, in order to reach your house and downtown, gosh, that would take billions of volts of electricity and cost tens of millions of dollars.
But it is possible.
We cured polio in '53.
Landed on the moon in '69.
As I tell my students, once you open up that curiosity door, anything is possible.
[ROBIN, DUSTIN, AND STEVE] "The week is long", the silver cat feeds, "when blue meets yellow in the west".
I mean, it just it just can't be right.
- [ROBIN] It's right.
- Honestly, I think it's great news.
How is this great news? [CHUCKLES] I mean, so much for being American heroes.
- It's total nonsense.
- It's not nonsense.
It's too specific.
It's obviously a code.
- What do you mean, a code? - Like a super secret spy code.
- That's a total stretch.
- [ROBIN] I don't know, is it? You're buying into this? Listen, just for kicks, let's entertain the possibility that it is a secret Russian transmission.
What'd you think they were gonna say, "Fire the warhead at noon"? - Exactly.
- And my translation is correct.
I know that for sure, so "The silver cat feeds".
Why would anyone talk like that unless they're trying to mask - the meaning of their message? - Exactly.
Why would anyone mask the true meaning of their message unless the message was somehow sensitive? Exactly.
- So I guess that confirms your suspicion.
- Evil Russians.
I can't believe I'm about to agree with this strange child, but, yeah, totally evil Russians.
So how do we crack it? Well, I guess we translate the rest and hopefully a pattern emerges.
A pattern.
Right, like maybe "silver cat" is a meeting place? Or a person.
Or a weapon.
It's probably gonna take a super genius to crack it, but Where's Steve? - [ROBIN] Hey, Steve.
- [COINS CLATTER] What are you doing? Uh, it's a quarter.
I need Do you have a quarter? [CHUCKLES] - Sure you're tall enough for that ride? - Quarter! [WALTZ TUNE PLAYING] You need help getting up, little Stevie? - Shh! - [DUSTIN CHUCKLES] Would you two just shut up and listen? [WALTZ TUNE CONTINUES] Holy shit.
The music.
The music! - [MAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN] - [WALTZ TUNE PLAYING] I don't understand.
It's the exact same song on the recording.
Maybe they have horses like this in Russia.
"Indiana Flyer"? I don't I don't think so.
This code, it didn't come from Russia.
It came from here.
[CHAMBER MUSIC PLAYING] [COUPLE LAUGHING] [WAITER CLEARS THROAT] Would you like to order your entrÃ©e, sir? [SLURRING] You know what, Enzo? My name is not Enzo.

- What? - My full name! Oh, my God.
Okay, Will the Wise, can you please turn down the music? That is not music.
That is the sound of destiny! I have seen into the future, and I've seen that today is a new day, a day free of girls! What is happening right now? Will, come on.
A tribe of villagers are under threat from an evil force from the swamps of Kuzatan.
Will, it's so early.
Is it? Is it early, Michael? Tell that to the villagers crying for your help, the children so frightened, they cannot sleep.
Are you truly going to let them perish? Or are you going to come to their rescue and become the heroes you were always meant to be? Uh Can I at least take a shower first? Oh, God.
Hopper? Are you there? Oh! Look who it is! We need to talk.
Yeah, we do.
I haven't been stood up like that since Alice Gilbert in the 9th grade.
What are you doing? Joyce.
- Hello? - Just watch.
Okay, you're freaking me out.
- You slipped on this, remember? - Yeah.
Yeah, it fell in the night.
It lost its magnetism.
- Oh, did it? - And the same exact thing happened at my house the day before.
- Wow.
- And I thought, "Okay, that's weird.
" Right? Why are all these magnets suddenly losing their magnetism? - Uh-huh? - So, I went and saw Scott.
Scott.
Who's Scott? - Scott Clarke.
- Your child's science teacher? He's pretty brilliant, actually.
And I asked him, "How is this happening?" And he built this magnetic field using an AC transformer and plugging it into a solenoid.
And And with that solenoid, which basically Slow down, slow down.
I just want to get this exactly right, okay? You stand me up no phone call, no apology, because you had to go to Scott Clarke's house.
Yeah.
You've outdone yourself, Joyce.
You really have.
No, you've outdone yourself.
Oh, come on, Hop, you're not even listening to me.
Scott was able to demagnetize some of the magnets, and he thinks I don't care what Scott thinks! He thinks that a large-scale magnetic field could be built using some sort of machine or or experimental technology.
He's brilliant, isn't he? He's really brilliant.
Is he single too? What if it's them? To build a machine like this, you need resources.
You need scientists, you need funding, - tens of millions of dollars.
- Joyce.
It can't just be a coincidence, Hopper.
It has to be them.
Joyce, stop.
It has to be the lab.
It is impossible.
- Well, then, prove it to me.
- Prove it? - Yeah, take me back there.
- To the lab.
Yeah, I wanna go back.
Because some magnets fell off your fridge.
Yes.
Okay, makes sense.
Thank you.
It makes sense.
I'm sorry.
I'm a little busy right now, but maybe we can meet up there, like tonight, like seven o'clock? You know, of course, unless something comes up - which, you know, it will.
- You know, after everything that's happened, this is no joke.
No, I don't think it's a joke.
I think that when I asked you out, I think you got scared.
I think you got scared, and now, you're inventing things.
You're inventing things to get worked up about so that you can push me away.
Because God forbid any of us move on! Because that that would be I mean, that would be too much, right, Joyce? You know? That would be too much, wouldn't it, Joyce? Wouldn't it, Joyce? Joyce? Joyce! - What the hell are you doing? - I need to borrow these.
No, you're not going back there.
Joyce Joyce, you're not going back there Son of a bitch! It's gonna start pouring soon.
We should be at the mall or, like, watching a movie or something.
You don't believe me? I believe you saw some super weird stuff, totally, but you said Mike has sensed you in there before, right? So maybe it was just like that.
Maybe Billy just sensed you somehow.
- But the screams.
- Yeah, I know, but here's the thing.
When Billy is alone with a girl, they make, like, really crazy noises.
- They scream? - Yeah, but, like happy screams.
- Happy screams? What is happy screams? - It's like I'm just gonna lend you my mom's Cosmo.
His car's not here.
You really want to do this? Why do I get the feeling we're gonna find all kinds of wrong in here? Ugh! Gag me with a spoon.
Max? Ice.
It's just ice.
Probably for his muscles or something.
He works out like a maniac.
El, what is it? You sure about this? You really are your mother's son, you know that? What's that supposed to mean? It means you worry too much.
- Huh.
- I got this, okay? Okay.
So, what exactly are we looking at here? Is this the Driscoll lady's stuff? No.
No, see, that's the thing.
I mean, listen, I thought she was crazy too, but She told me Johnson killed Kennedy.
But, it turns out, she's not alone.
Blackburn's Supply, Hawkins Farming, the Crawleys, they've all had some supplies go missing, all in the past few days.
And it's not just fertilizer.
It's pesticides, cleaning supplies, diesel fuel.
And that's just from one day of calling around.
I mean there's gotta be more.
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Let me get this little story of yours straight.
So, little rodents have gone cuckoo in their furry little minds and they're running around the town of Hawkins, dining out on chemicals.
I know how it sounds, but But you've got proof! I mean, fellas, you gotta admit, it's a hell of a headline, right? "Hawkins Rodents Prefer Poison: Nutjob Tells All.
" Guys, that's enough.
I think this is big.
Bigger than one article.
In fact, I think this has got to be a book.
The Mysterious Case of the Missing Fertilizer, a Nancy Drew mystery.
Next time a call comes in, do what you were hired for, and let us know, yeah? Ah We'll decide what's a story and what's not.
Okay.
Bye-bye, Nancy Drew.
Hey, it's okay.
Nancy.
Nancy! Excuse me.
Ahoy! I'd like to try the peanut butter chocolate swirl, please.
No.
No more samples today.
Why not? Because you're abusing our company policy.
Where's the sailor man? Sorry, he can't help you.
He's busy.
Busy with what? Spycraft.
You see anything? Uh, I guess I don't totally know what I'm looking for.
Evil Russians.
Yeah, exactly.
I don't know what an evil Russian looks like.
- Tall, blond, not smiling.
- Mm-hmm? Also, look for earpieces, camo, duffel bags, that sort of thing.
Right, okay, duffel bags.
- Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
- What? Anna Jacobi's talking with that meathead Mark Lewinsky.
If you're not gonna focus, just gimme the binoculars.
Aw, Jesus Christ, whatever happened to standards? I mean, Lewinsky never even came off the bench.
Dude, you are the worst spy in history, you know that? - Stop, hey.
Stop.
- Give me those.
I don't get why you're looking at girls.
You have the perfect one in front of you.
- Seriously, if you say Robin again - Robin.
- No, don't.
No.
- Robin, Robin, Robin.
- Stop, no, no, no.
- Robin.
Robin.
- Robin.
- No.
- Robin.
- No! No, man, she's not my type.
She's not even in the ballpark of what my type is, all right? What's your type again? Not awesome? - Thank you.
- Hm.
For your information, she's still in school.
And she's weird.
She's a weirdo.
And she's hyper.
I don't like that she's hyper.
And she did drama.
That's a bad look.
And she's in band? - No.
- Now that you're out of high school, which means you're technically an adult, don't you think it's time you move on from primitive constructs such as popularity? Oh, primitive constructs? That some stupid shit you learned at Camp Know Nothing? Camp Know Where, actually.
- And no, it's shit I learned from life.
- Hm.
Instead of dating somebody you think's gonna make you cooler, why not date somebody you actually enjoy being around? Like me and Suzie.
Oh, Suzie.
Yeah, you mean, "hotter than Phoebe Cates.
" Yeah, that Suzie.
And, uh, let's think about how exactly did you score that beautiful girlfriend? Oh, yeah.
With my advice.
Because that's how this works, Henderson.
I give you the advice, you follow through.
Not the other way around, all right, pea-brain? Do you guys hear that? It sounds like thunder.
But, no, wait.
That's not thunder.
It's a horde of juju zombies! Sir Mike, your action.
What should I do? Attack? Okay, I attack with my flail.
Whoosh! You miss.
Your flail clanks the stone, the zombie horde lumbers towards you, and the juju bites your arm.
Flesh tears! Aah! Seven points of damage.
Oh, no, my arm.
Lucas, look, my arm.
Sir Lucas, the zombie horde roars! Do you fight back or do you run? No! It's a distraction! A trap.
Do not answer it.
What No! El? No.
Sorry, not interested.
Telemarketers.
Maybe we should just call them.
We can do that? - I think so.
- Yeah, but what would we say? We'll say nothing! The Khuisar tribe still needs your help.
All right, then.
I'll use my torch to set fire to the chambers, sacrificing ourselves, killing the jujus, and saving the Khuisar.
We all live on as heroes in the memories of the Kalamar.
Victory.
Okay.
Fine.
You guys win.
- Congratulations.
- Will, I was just messing around.
Hey, let's finish for real.
- How much longer is the campaign? - Just forget it, Mike.
No, you want to keep playing, right? Y-Yeah, totally.
We'll just call the girls afterwards.
I said forget it, Mike, okay? - I'm going home.
- But - Come on, Will.
- Move! Will, come on.
You can't leave.
It's raining.
Listen, I said I was sorry, all right? It's a cool campaign.
It's really cool.
We're just not in the mood right now.
Yeah, Mike.
That's the problem.
You guys are never in the mood anymore.
- You're ruining our party.
- That's not true.
Really? Where's Dustin right now? See? You don't know and you don't even care.
And obviously he doesn't either and I don't blame him.
You're destroying everything, and for what? So you can swap spit with some stupid girl? El's not stupid.
It's not my fault you don't like girls.
I'm not trying to be a jerk.
Okay? But we're not kids anymore.
I mean, what did you think, really? That we were never gonna get girlfriends? We were just gonna sit in my basement all day and play games for the rest of our lives? Yeah.
I guess I did.
I really did.
Will.
Will! Will, come on! Excuse me.
No one in the water until 30 minutes after the last strike.
And don't try and argue with me.
You wanna get electrocuted, go climb a tree.
Yeah, we don't care.
We're not here to swim.
Or get electrocuted.
We found this.
Does that belong to anybody? Oh, yeah.
That's Heather's.
I'll get it back to her.
We could give it back to her.
You could.
'Cept she's not here.
Bailed on me today.
What is this? You girls want a reward or somethin'? No.
We're just Good Samaritans.
Heather.
Do you think you can find her? No way! What do you see? A door.
A red door.
Help me.
Help me! No! What happened? El! Hello? Anybody home? We come in peace.
No! No! Let's go! Joyce.
You okay? I'm fine.
You want to wait in the car? I said I'm fine.
- Target acquired.
- Where? - Ten o'clock.
Sam Goody's.
- Give me that.
Shit.
Duffel bag.
Evil Russian.
Slow down.
We're losin' him.
- You're getting too close.
- Watch it, dickwad.
Hello.
Yes.
I am fine.
How are you? All right, everyone, listen up! I just have one question for you.
Who is ready to sweat? That's right! Okay! Let's start it nice and easy now.
Let's move our thighs.
Yeah! Yeah, ladies, warm it up.
Bring it down to your hips.
Start feeling that burn, everywhere, down in the loins, right? Come on, ladies, show me what you got.
Slow now.
Just isolate.
Ooh, tip that up.
That feels good! "The week is long.
" The silver cat feeds when blue meets yellow in the west.
"A trip to China sounds nice if you tread lightly.
" "Tread lightly"? - Delivery for you.
- Thank you.
- Have a nice day.
- Yeah, you too.
Silver cat.
Silver cat.
You're not gonna believe who Dustin thought was a Russian.
- You did too.
- No, I did not.
- Yes, you did.
- No, I did not.

Robin.
What are you doing? - I cracked it.
- Cracked what? I cracked the code.
Oh-ho-ho! Oh! There it is! Careful! It might have rabies! Better get that thing outta here.
You don't want it eatin' the tires off your car.
Come on! What - What's this? - Proof.
Proof? They said they wanted proof, right? So let's give it to 'em.
A rubber rat? No, the real rat.
Driscoll's rat.
You said yourself it looked sick.
We can take it to an animal control center, they can run some blood tests on it, - figure out what's wrong with it - Whoa, Nancy, slow down.
Tom didn't ask for proof.
He asked us to drop the story.
That's because he didn't believe us.
- Nancy.
- I'm right.
That's not the point.
Then what's the point? You should've thought about that before you talked to them.
All right? They're assholes, okay? I get it.
But it's just some stupid story.
Oh, it's stupid? It's stupid to get fired over.
No one's going to fire us.
Look, if you don't want to go, that's fine.
Just give me the keys.
You're relentless, you know that? Come on.
Nobody's home.
All the cavities have been filled.
I watched 'em do it, Joyce.
Will! It's over.
It's over.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
You're not losing your mind.
Not any more than I am.
You know, the other day, I almost shot Betsy Payne's dog because it came rushing at me from behind this fence, and I I swear to God, I thought it was one of those things.
You know that I'm keeping a close eye on things, right? - Yeah.
- Because it's important to me.
It is important to me that you feel safe.
That you and your family feel safe.
I want you to feel like this can still be your home.
What? You didn't think I'd find out about that? Gary called me.
He said he's fixing up your house to put on the market.
The kids know yet? After Sarah I had to get away.
I had to get the hell out of that place, you know? Outrun those, uh those memories, I guess.
I mean, why do you think I ended up back in this shithole? But you have something that I never had.
You have people that know what you've been through.
You have people that care about you.
Right here.
In Hawkins.
You mean You mean, people like Scott Clarke.
That was a joke.
Mm.
What's that? Wait here.
Will! Will, I'm sorry, man, all right? I was being a total asshole.
Please, can you just come outside and we'll talk? Will! Hey, Will! Come on, man! We're sorry! Will! Something is coming, something hungry for blood.
- What is it? - What if it's the Demogorgon? Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed if it's the Demogorgon.
It's not the Demogorgon.
- Will, your action! - Fireball! Fourteen! Direct hit! Will the Wise's fireball hits the thessalhydra! - Who you gonna call? - Ghostbusters! - Egon! - Venkman! Stupid.
So stupid.
So stupid.
Stupid.
Mrs.
Driscoll? Oh, she must not be home.
She's an 80-year-old woman and it's pouring.
Where else would she be? - Whoa, what are you doing? - Maybe she fell.
Or something.
Nancy Mrs.
Driscoll? - Seriously? - Mrs.
Driscoll? It's Nancy.
From The Hawkins Post.
Mrs.
Driscoll? Mrs.
Driscoll? Look for Imperial Panda and Kaufman Shoes.
They're with that whistling guy, ten o'clock.
- What do you think's in there? - Guns, bombs? Chemical weapons? Whatever it is, they're armed to the teeth.
Great.
That's great.
Hey, what's in there? It's just more boxes.
Let me check it out.
- No, I'm still looking.
- Lemme see it.
Hang on! Duck! Stay here.
Watch the door.
Well, I think we found your Russians.
This is Hawkins Chief of Police! Come out with your hands up! You hear me? Hands up! Hopper! Hopper! Hopper! Hopper! Hopper! Is this it? - This is her house.
- What? Heather's house.
Isn't that cute, huh? He's so funny.
Max.
We didn't mean to barge in.
We tried to knock, but maybe you didn't hear us over the storm.
I'm sorry, who is this dripping all over my living room right now? I'm sorry.
Janet, Tom, this is my sister, Maxine.
Oh! What on earth are you doing here? Is something wrong? We just wanted to make sure everything was okay.
Okay? - Why wouldn't it be okay? - Where is she? I'm sorry.
Where is who? Well, they're a little burnt, I'm sorry Heather! This is my sister, Maxine.
And, I'm sorry, I did not quite catch your name.
El.
El.
Now, what is it you were saying, El? You were looking for somebody? I I saw - I saw you - Your manager.
At the pool.
He said you guys didn't come in to work today, so we got worried.
Heather wasn't feeling so hot today, so we thought we'd take the day off to nurse her back to health.
But you're feeling just fine right now, aren't you, Heather? I'm feeling so much better.
Do you girls want a cookie? They're fresh out of the oven.
Will! Will! What happened? Are you okay? He's back.
He was singin' Bye bye Miss American Pie Is everything all right? Yes.
Everything's fine.
Your sister really didn't want to stay? No, she's just not you know, really a people person.
Well, I just don't like the idea of them out there in the storm like that.
Oh, they'll be fine.
Oh! I told you to slow down on that wine, Janet.
Yes, darling.
Are you okay, Mommy? Yes, I'm I'm just feeling a little lightheaded is all.
Hm.
It's all that wine.
I'm sorry.
Um, if you'll excuse me, I'm just gonna go upstairs and lie down for a bit.
Janet? half-time air was sweet perfume Janet? Janet? Janet! Janet! Call 911! Call 91 never got the chance I'm really sorry about this, Daddy, but it'll all be over soon, I promise.
we started singin' Bye bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good ol' boys were drinking whiskey and rye Singin' this'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die Oh, and there we were all in one place A generation lost in space With no time left to start again So come on Jack be nimble Jack be quick Jack Flash sat on a candlestick 'Cause fire is the Devil's only friend Oh, and as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in Hell Could break that Satan's spell And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial rite I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the music died He was singin' Bye bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good ol' boys were drinking whiskey and rye Singin' this'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die

1 [THUNDER RUMBLING] [BILLY] I'm sorry, I did not quite catch your name.
[DISTORTED SCREAMING] [MAX] What happened? Help me.
[SCREAMING] No! [THUNDERCLAP] Which one? I don't know.
Hey, there's nothing to worry about anymore, okay? It doesn't make sense.
What doesn't make sense? Heather.
The blood.
The ice.
Heather had a fever, so she took a cold bath, but she's better now.
That has to be it.
I don't know where that blood came from, but we saw her.
We both saw her.
She's totally fine.
What about Billy? What about him? He seemed wrong.
[CHUCKLES] Wrong is kind of like his default.
But it's nice to know he's not a murderer, because that would've totally sucked.
[CHUCKLES] Who is that? See, this is why you can't just hang out with Mike all the time.
This is Wonder Woman.
AKA Princess Diana.
She's from Paradise Island, which is, like, this hidden island where there are only women Amazon warriors.
[THUNDER RUMBLING] [MRS.
DRISCOLL SCREAMING] Let me go! Let me go! Doris, we need you to stay calm for us, okay? - Stay calm.
- I have to go back! I have to go back! I have to go back! I have to go back! Okay, so, you two want to explain to me what in the name of Jesus just happened here? [AMBULANCE DOORS CLOSING] [SIREN WAILING] [MUFFLED SCREAMING] [SHRIEKING] [PANTING] [STRAINING] [MUFFLED] Tom! [SOBBING] [TOM SOBS] - [ECHOING FOOTSTEPS] - [GASPS] [TOM WHIMPERS] Hi, Daddy.
Heather sweetie whatever this is, whatever he's got you into, you don't have to do this.
You can stop this.
There is no stopping it, Daddy.
[GASPS] You'll see.
[JANET SOBBING] No.
[WHIMPERING] [SOBBING] [WHIMPERING] Heather, please! Heather! Try not to move.
No.
No.
- [GASPS] - [GRUNTS] Heather! Heather! [CREATURE SNARLING] [ROARING] Jesus Christ.
[HEAVY FOOTSTEPS] [SNARLING AND ROARING] [TOM WAILS] [TOM] No.
[SNARLING] [TOM] No [SCREAMING] [MUFFLED GRUNTS] [CREATURE SNARLING] [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRDSONG] [GROANS] [COUGHS] [JOYCE] Hey, careful.

- [HOPPER COUGHS] Here.
Hey.
Joyce.
[HOPPER SIGHS] [RETCHING] Oh.
Here, here, here.
[COUGHING, VOMITING] It's okay.
[LOUD VOMITING] That's it.
Got it? [GROANS] - Here.
- How long have I been out? A while.
You've been drifting in and out.
Yeah, but how did I get here? Slowly.
- What's the last thing you remember? - Some thug attacked me.
- Hey, you need to rest.
- No, I'm fine.
- No, you're not fine, Hop - I'm fine.
I'm fine.
[EXCLAIMS] Um - Where are my clothes? - Uh Uh [SHARP EXHALE] They were soaked.
I mean, did you recognize him? - Who? - The thug.
[HOPPER] Well, I didn't get a good look.
Well, I mean, he's gotta be government, right? Yeah, but if he's government, what's he doing slinking around? W-Why is he running? You know, why didn't we find anything down there? Let's ask him.
What is that? His license plate.
- What are the dashes? - Well, they're blanks.
There was I think it was either an H or a P with the part rubbed off.
And there was definitely a Y.
For sure.
And that, I think, was a B, but it could've been an eight.
And that Wait I think you should stick to sales.
Can't you run a search or something? I just think you have to lower your expectations.
I mean, this is a state government agency.
Gonna take weeks before they find a match.
- Weeks? - If we're lucky.
And, I mean, what are the odds that this guy registers a car in his own name? It wasn't a car.
[CLEARS THROAT] Uh, what are you wearing? What do you mean it wasn't a car? [LUCAS OVER RADIO] Do you copy? This is a code red.
[RADIO STATIC POPS] I repeat, this is a code red.
Max.
Do you copy? - This is a code red.
- [MAX SCOFFS] Shut up.
She turned it off.
[PHONE RINGING] [SCOFFS] You've got to be kidding me.
I'm sleeping.
Go away.
[MIKE] This is Mike.
Do not hang up.
Something happened, something bad.
Our very lives can be at stake.
- What are you talking about? - Just come over to my house.
We'll explain everything.
- [MAX] What? - Hurry.
[CLICK, DIAL TONE DRONES] What did he say? Try Dustin again.
He's not answering.
So, try him again.
Dustin, do you copy? I repeat, this is a code red.
[DUSTIN] That keycard opens the door, but unfortunately, the Russian with this keycard also has a massive gun.
Whatever's in this room, whatever's in those boxes, they really don't want anybody finding it.
But there's gotta be a way in.
Well, you know I could just take him out.
- Take who out? - The Russian guard.
What? I sneak up behind him, I knock him out, and I take his keycard.
It's easy.
Did you not hear the part about the massive gun? Yes, Dustin, I did.
And that's why I would be sneaking.
Ah.
Well, please, tell me this, and be honest, have you ever actually won a fight? Okay, that was one time Twice.
Jonathan.
Year prior? Listen, that doesn't count.
Why wouldn't it? Because it looks like he beat the shit out of you.
- It was - You got a fat lip, crooked nose, - swollen eye, a lot of blood - things that all added up That just might work.
[STEVE] Robin.
Hey, Robin! Hey, what what are you doing? - I need cash.
- Well, half of that's mine.
- Where're you going? - To find a way into that room, a safe way.
And, in the meantime, sling ice cream, behave, and don't get beat up.
I'll be back in a jiff.
Oh, dude.
Come on, man, not my scooper.
[PHONE RINGING] [DRAWER OPENS, CLOSES] [MAN] If he gets us the layout by noon, we can.
[WOMAN] Okay, I'll let him know.
[MAKES CHOKING NOISE] [LAUGHS] Dunno if they'll go through with it, but I just thought you should know.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Nancy.
Jonathan.
[TOM] I've worked at this paper for twenty-five years.
Twenty-five years.
Now, we're a small-town paper, but we have something the big papers don't have: trust.
- The trust of our community.
- Tom, if you just Do you know how I built that trust? By placing my faith in something the two of you don't seem to value a whole lot: facts.
Facts.
So, while we're here, let's go over the facts.
Fact one: you disobeyed a direct order to stop pursuing this story.
Two: you falsely identified yourselves as reporters, repeatedly lying to an elderly woman.
Three: you broke into her home, committing trespass.
Four: she almost died en route to the hospital.
She would've died if we hadn't shown up! Whatever disease that rat had clearly passed to her Five! Mrs.
Driscoll is a paranoid schizophrenic.
You didn't know that, did you? Now disease-carrying rats? The second coming of the plague? Does this sound credible to you, or perhaps does this sound more like the delusions of a very sick old lady? - I didn't know that.
- Her family's furious.
So furious, in fact, they've threatened litigation.
- Litigation? - That's crazy.
For once, we agree.
This is crazy.
In fact, in my entire professional career, I've never dealt with anything quite like it.
But hopefully, hopefully, you've learned something valuable here.
You've learned how in the workplace, in the real world, there are consequences to your actions.
Which brings me to my sixth and final fact.
You're fired.
Both of you.
[WILL] I didn't think it was anything at first.
I mean, I think I just didn't want to believe it.
The first time I felt it was at Day of the Dead.
[FLUTTERING SOUND] - Power went out that night, too.
- And then I felt it again at the field near the Nelson farm the next day.
[GASPS] Then again yesterday outside Castle Byers.
[FLUTTERING SOUND] [LUCAS] Will! What does it feel like? It's almost like You know when you drop on a roller coaster? - Sure.
- Yeah.
- No.
- It's like everything inside your body is just sinking all at once, but this is worse.
Your body it goes cold and and you can't breathe.
I've felt it before, whenever he was close.
- [THUNDERCLAP] - [SNARLING] Whenever who was close? The Mind Flayer.
Go away! Go away! I closed the gate.
I know, but what if he never left? What if we locked him out here with us? This is him.
All of him.
But, that day on the field, a part of him attached itself to me.
[HYPERVENTILATING] My mom got it out of me Get the hell out of my son! and Eleven closed the gate.
[SCREAMING] But the part that was still in me, what if it's still in our world? In Hawkins.
I don't understand.
The Demodogs died when El closed the gate.
[MAX] If the brain dies, the body dies.
We can't take any chances.
We need to assume the worst.
The Mind Flayer's back.
[WILL] Yeah.
And if he is, he'd want to attach himself to someone again.
A new me.
A new host.
How can you tell if someone is a host? [HOPPER GRUMBLES] Hey, is he in? - Yes, he's busy at the moment, but - Great.
Excuse me.
You should sit down.
wouldn't listen Uh Tony, hold on.
Let me, uh I might have to Let me call you back.
Okay.
Thanks.
- Jim.
- I know, I know.
You're busy.
I'm gonna make this fast, I promise.
Is there some kind of problem? Yeah.
You might say that.
Um, I'm looking for the name of a guy.
The name of a guy.
Yeah, I think you might know this guy.
- Okay.
- He was here the other day.
Rides a motorcycle.
Big build, square jaw, dark hair.
He's probably military, maybe ex-military? Is this ringing any bells? Uh [CHUCKLES] I don't think so.
Really? 'Cause it was just two days ago.
This was right before I saw you.
Oh! - You know what? - What? Could be the maintenance guy.
- Maintenance.
- Yeah.
I can't remember his name.
Oh, God Uh Gary or John or something.
Candice will have his name on file.
We've had trouble with the plumbing.
Clogged toilets and sinks with minds of their own.
[CHUCKLES] You meeting with a lot of plumbers, Larry? Excuse me? This guy, when I saw him, he was coming out of your office.
Okay, well, I don't remember that.
I shake a lot of hands, you know? Do you remember when I caught you passed out in the hideaway with all that powder all over your nose? - You remember? - Jim, come on, now.
Do you remember when my boys found you and Candice going at it like a couple of bunnies in the back of your Cadillac? Do you remember that? Does your wife remember that? You, uh [CLEARS THROAT] You really wanna play this game? Huh? Not a game, Lar.
Okay.
Those pills you used to swallow like candy.
I can't recall, did you have a prescription for those? Or how about drinking on duty? [CHUCKLING] Yeah.
We have some real fun stories about that.
[CHUCKLES] One call to Tom at the Post and you're done, buddy.
You're gone.
Oh, and, please, don't give me that dead daughter sob story, 'cause I just don't care.
Now, if you don't mind, I really am rather busy.
Operating directors [LARRY GRUNTS] Damn it! [WAILING] My nose! You broke my goddamn nose! And your friend almost killed me last night, so I'd say we're still not even.
Larry? - [HOPPER] Let's cut the crap, Larry! - Larry! - Who is this guy? Government? Military? - You're making a big mistake.
Who is he? It's Arnold Schwarzenegger.
- [CANDICE] Larry! - [LARRY GROANS] Who you calling? The police? That is a nice ring you got there, Larry.
Are you insane? I don't know.
Let's find out.
[GRUNTS] Okay, okay, okay.
Be cool, be cool.
I don't know his name, I swear.
- [SIGHS] - [SCREAMS] Ah, ah, ah! But you know him.
He He gives me things sometimes.
What kind of things? Money.
Presents.
Aah! Gifts.
Who is this guy, Santa Claus? Starcourt.
Starcourt.
He works for Starcourt.
- The mall? - Yes, yes.
Yeah, right.
Aah! I swear! I swear! I swear! Starcourt.
They They own the mall.
They want to expand to East Hawkins.
They needed property, some land.
Some people didn't want to sell, so I leaned on them a little.
That's all.
I swear, that's all.
[SIGHS, GROANS] [GROANS] - Why do they want this land? - I don't know! You have records of these purchases, these, uh these land purchases? [BREATHING RAPIDLY] You don't want to mess with these people, Jim.
I think you should worry about yourself right now, Larry, not about me.
The records.
Where are they? - [LARRY GROANS] - Larry? [HOPPER] He just bumped his head.
- Just a little boo-boo, right, Lar? - [GRUNTS] Have a nice day.
Larry! [NANCY] It's bullshit.
So, according to Tom, Driscoll's just a schizophrenic? And that rat is just a rat? And it's all, what, some big coincidence? You know what I think? I think Tom was on drugs.
- What? - Did you see him? He was sweating like crazy.
And his palms were clammy.
- He looked awful.
- [CHUCKLES] - Oh, is this funny to you? - No.
No, it's just kind of incredible.
Incredible? Yeah, incredible how you just continue to convince yourself.
What's that supposed to mean? I told you over and over to drop this story.
- That it was a bad idea.
- [SCOFFS] But you refused, and now, I'm screwed.
It's a summer job.
Your life is hardly over.
I don't live in a two-story house on Maple Street.
My dad doesn't earn six figures.
Hell, he isn't even around.
God, here comes the Oliver Twist routine.
Mortgage, college tuition.
You know, they're real things, Nancy.
Things that you don't care about, only because you don't have to.
- I didn't realize I lived in a bubble! - Well, you do! You want everything handed to you on a silver platter.
I mean, we were interns, Nancy! Interns! What did you expect, that you would make star reporter in a month? Crack the big case? You sound just like them.
You realize that, right? Just like Bruce and those assholes Yeah, yeah, those assholes gave us jobs.
Is that what that was? That was humiliating.
Humiliating.
Yeah, the real world sucks.
Deal with it like the rest of us.
You don't know what it's like.
Neither do you.
[SCOFFS] Well, then, I guess we just don't understand each other anymore.
Yeah, I guess not.
Hey, you're home early.
Yeah.
Light day.
[NANCY SNIFFLES] [ROBIN] It is fascinating what 20 bucks will get you at the County Recorder's Office.
Starcourt Mall.
The complete blueprints.
Not bad.
So, this is us, Scoops, and this is where we want to get.
I mean, I don't really see a way in.
There's not, if you're talking exclusively about doors.
Air ducts.
Exactly.
Turns out, this secret room needs air just like any old room.
And these air ducts lead all the way here.
Flashlight.
Thank you.
Yeah, I don't know, man.
I don't know if you can fit in here.
It's, like super tight.
I'll fit.
Trust me.
No collar bones, remember? Uh, excuse me? Oh, he's, uh Yeah, he's got some disease.
Chry, uh It's chrydo, um Something.
Yeah, I dunno.
He's missing bones and stuff.
He can bend like Gumbo.
You mean Gumby.
I'm pretty sure it's Gumbo.
- Steve, just shut up and push me! - Okay.
I'll push ya.
- Not my feet, dumbass.
Push my ass.
- [STEVE] What? Touch my butt! I don't care! - Come on! Harder! Push harder! - I'm pushing! You're playing with my legs.
I'm not playing, I have terrible footing.
- Come on! - I'm gonna just shove you, ready? - [DUSTIN] Just shove me? - One, two - Shit.
- [STEVE] That work? - [DUSTIN] One more time.
- Ahoy, sailors! All hands on deck! Ahoy! - [BELL DINGING] - [ERICA] Come on.
Get over here and serve me some samples.
I don't know.
He looks pretty normal to me.
Normal? How many times have you seen him with a shirt on? I mean, it's a little weird.
More than a little.
He was in a tub with ice.
The Mind Flayer likes it cold.
- Plus everything else - But he's lounging at the pool, which is, like, the least Mind Flayer thing ever.
Not necessarily.
The Mind Flayer likes to hide.
He only used me when he needed me.
It's like like you're dormant.
And then, when he needs you, you're activated.
Okay, so we just wait until he gets activated.
No.
What if he hurts someone? Or kills someone.
We can't take that chance.
We need to find out if he's the host.
- Where are you going? - I have an idea.
Boys only.
- Seriously? - Just trust me on this one.
Okay, so we wait until the pool closes, until everyone leaves, and we somehow get him to come from here and get him into here.
- Hey, shut the door! - [MAN] Hey, come on, kid, shut it! I think I just threw up in my mouth.
And look, the controls are right here.
It's perfect.
- Will it get hot enough? - 220 degrees.
We just have to figure out how to get him in here.
- Then we lock him in - Heat him up No matter what happens, we'll know.
We'll know for sure.
Hmm - Yeah, I don't know.
- You don't know if you can fit? Oh, I can fit.
I just don't know if I want to.
Are you claustrophobic? [SNICKERS] I don't have phobias.
- Okay, well, what's the problem? - The problem is, I still haven't heard what's in this for Erica.
[NAUTICAL TUNE PLAYING] More fudge, please.
Go on.
[ROBIN] All right.
You see this? This is the route you're gonna take.
Then we just wait till the last delivery goes out tonight.
Then you knock out the grate, jump down, open the door.
- Then you find out what's in those boxes? - Exactly.
[ERICA] Mm-hmm.
And you say this guard is armed.
Yes, but he won't be there.
- And booby traps? - Booby traps? - Lasers, spikes in the wall? - What? You know what this half-baked plan of yours sounds like to me? Child endangerment.
We'll be in radio contact with you the whole time Ah, ah, ah! Child endangerment.
Erica? Hi.
Uh We think these Russians want to do harm to our country.
Great harm.
Don't you love your country? You can't spell "America" without "Erica".
[SLURPING LOUDLY] Uh, yeah, yeah.
Oddly, that's, uh, totally true.
So, so, don't do this for us.
Do it for your country.
Do it for your fellow man.
- [SLURPING CONTINUES] - Do this for America Erica.
Ooh! I just got the chills.
Oh, yeah, from this float, not your speech.
Know what I love most about this country? Capitalism.
- Do you know what capitalism is? - Yeah.
- Yeah.
- It means this is a free market system.
Which means people get paid for their services, depending on how valuable their contributions are.
And it seems to me, my ability to fit into that little vent is very, very valuable to you all.
So, you want my help? This USS Butterscotch better be the first of many.
And I'm talking free ice cream for life.
[HOPPER WHISTLES] Wow, I love the place, Lar.
Hey, you shoot that fella yourself? [LARRY WINCES] That's That's not real.
No shit! All right, so what exactly are we looking at? Land deeds, transfers of property.
So your buddies at Starcourt, they suddenly start buying up all this property.
- They tell you why? - I already told you, they don't tell me anything.
They're just using you, I get it.
What I don't get is why you have a bunch of land deeds in a safe in your bedroom.
These people, Jim, they're bad news.
So, what, this is blackmail? - Protection.
- Protection.
Hold on a second.
Hey, what is it? Hess Farm, Henry's place, Bullocks Look, they're all here.
They're all in Southeast Hawkins, right near Jordan Lake.
And what else is near Jordan Lake? The power plant.
Four nights ago, there was a huge power outage, - and the next day - Your magnets fell.
Yeah, I mean, Scott says that this machine would take a massive amount of power to run.
- Yeah.
- So, what if this machine that we've been talking about really does exist, and the reason that we didn't find it at the lab is because it isn't at the lab, it's at one of these properties.
Um I want you to forget about sales.
I want you to come work for me at the Hawkins PD.
And have to look at your face every day? I don't think so.
[CLATTERING] Larry! Hey! Hey, where do you think you're going, pal? [LARRY SCREAMS] - [KNOCKING] - [KAREN] Nancy? Nance? [SNIFFLES] [NANCY] Maybe Jonathan's right.
To be honest, I wasn't thinking about him.
I wasn't thinking about anyone, really.
I just I wanted to be right.
- I wanted to be right so badly.
- And were you? I thought so.
But maybe I just don't want to admit that I'm wrong, because if I'm wrong, then You're what everyone thinks you are.
Just a kid who has no idea what she's doing.
[SIGHS] It's not easy out there, Nance.
I know.
People are always saying you can't.
That you shouldn't.
That you're not smart enough, not good enough.
[SIGHS] This world, it it beats you up again and again until eventually, I Most people, they just they just stop trying.
But you're not like that.
You're a fighter.
You always have been.
I honestly don't know where you get it from.
[CHUCKLES] Dad.
[BOTH LAUGH] I think you were swapped in the hospital, to tell you the truth.
No.
I get it from you, Mom.
I get it from you.
Well, wherever you get it from, I'm proud of you.
Proud of me for getting fired? That you stood up for yourself.
That you stood up to those shitheads.
Mom! Yes, those shitheads.
[CHUCKLES, SNIFFLES] And if you believe in this story Look at me, Nancy.
finish it.
Then go sell it to The Indianapolis Star or whatever and I mean, can you imagine their faces when they read a story about their own town in a big paper like that? That would be pretty amazing.
So, why not? Why not? Finish it.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [LIGHTER CLICKS] Uh, Will? Um, you know, about yesterday It's fine, Lucas.
You don't have to say anything.

He's not really a friend.
He's more like an acquaintance.
Oh? Okay, well Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Keep up, keep up, keep up.
- Easy.
- [INSECTS BUZZING] Okay, so this acquaintance - lives in Illinois? Correct? - [HOPPER] Yeah, yeah.
[JOYCE] So we're walking to Illinois? Yeah, yeah, we're gonna walk to Illinois.
You know, I figure we'll get there by, like, Friday evening.
I hope that works for your schedule.
Jesus Christ, Joyce.
- We're not walking to Illinois, okay? - Well, then what are we doing? I don't know, okay? I will I will figure something out.
Isn't there someone in Indiana who speaks Russian that You know what? I'm all ears, Joyce.
I'm all ears.
I'm all ears! [JOYCE] I mean, fine.
Just saying.
Gah! Ugh! Gah! [SIGHS] [HOPPER] Damn it.
I found him.
[MAX] Where is he? Woods.
- [TV STATIC HISSING] - Woods? He's with Will's mom.

Well, it's a good thing you're not Mike, then.
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[BOTH CHUCKLE] [MIKE] Something's not right.
I can't get Hopper off my back all summer, now all of a sudden, he's hiking with Will's mom to Illinois? And Dustin's MIA, too? I mean, this can't be a coincidence.
What does it matter? The bottom line is, they're not here.
- It's up to us.
- Up to us to do what exactly? Find Billy and stop him.
Okay, yeah, that's a really nice sentiment, but even if El could find him again, and that's a pretty big if, then what? We burn the shit out of him and make sure he doesn't escape this time.
- Okay, then what? - Then we win.
No, see, that's the problem.
We don't.
We don't win.
We got the Mind Flayer out of Will before and he just came right back.
We don't just have to stop Billy, we have to stop the Mind Flayer.
- How in the hell do we do that? - I don't know.
Maybe El does.
What are they still doing in there? I don't know.
Girls just like hanging out in bathrooms.
Why? - I mean, I don't know.
- They're conspiring against me.
That's what you're concerned about now? It's not my main concern.
- It's just a sub-concern.
- I thought it was already over.
It's not over, okay? We're just taking a break.
She said she dumped your ass.
- That doesn't sound like a break.
- [MAX] It wasn't! You guys do realize we can still hear everything you're saying, right? [LAUGHS] [WHISPERS] Conspiring.
- I told you, they're conspiring.
- [KNOCK AT DOOR] Not now, Mom! [NANCY] Mike, open the door.
[DUSTIN] Code red, I repeat, code red.
Does anyone copy? This is a code red, I repeat, a code red.
This is a code red, I repeat, a code red.
Does anyone copy? We are innocent children and we are trapped under Starcourt Mall.
The Red Army has infiltrated Hawkins, and if we are found, they will torture and kill us.
[STEVE] Hey.
[GRUNTS] Gotta take it easy on that thing.
Gonna drain the battery.
- The mall just opened.
- So? So someone could be in range.
What do you think, Petey the Mall Cop is gonna rappel down here and save the day? All right, why are you such a cranky pants after getting to spend the night with Robin? Shh! Jesus Christ.
Will you just give up on your creepy dream already? I heard you guys talking all night.
We were trying to figure out a way to open up the door while you children were sleeping.
After eight hours, we're still exactly nowhere, which is, you know, probably just a little bit of the reason why I'm feeling just - a tad cranky.
- [UNZIPPING SOUND] What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? I'm taking a leak.
Look away.
Look away! [STEVE'S VOICE ECHOES] [SCOFFS] Can you redirect your stream, please? [ROBIN'S VOICE ECHOES] Ugh.
Hey, hey! Be careful, careful, careful! We don't even know what that is.
Exactly.
It could be useful.
Useful how? We can survive down here a long time without food, but if the human body doesn't get water, it will die.
I hate to break it to you, but this is not water.
No, but it's a liquid, and if it comes down to me drinking that shit or dying of thirst, I drink.
[SCOFFS] [DISTANT ELECTRONIC WHIRRING] We've got company.
[SUSPENSEFUL SYNTH MUSIC PLAYING] [BEEPING] [ELEVATOR DOOR THUDS] [INDISTINCT FEMALE VOICE ON PA] [SNIFFING] [IN RUSSIAN] You smell that? [IN RUSSIAN] What? Piss.
[SNIFFING] [ELEVATOR DOOR WHIRRING] [STEVE GRUNTS] Let's go.
- Go.
Go, go, go, go, go.
- [ERICA] I'm going! - Henderson.
Go, go.
- [VIAL BUCKLES] [ROBIN] Come on, Steve, let's go! [SIZZLING] - Jesus Christ.
- [ERICA] Ooh! You still wanna drink that? Holy mother of God.
Well hope you guys are in good shape.
Looking at you, roast beef.
Let's go, come on.
Why me? It was the same thing, the exact same thing that happened to Will last year.
And look at this.
Look at the body temperatures.
He likes it cold.
Okay, so this crazy old woman who was eating fertilizer - Mrs.
Driscoll.
- Right, yeah, Mrs.
Driscoll.
- What time was this attack? - Last night.
Right, but what time last night? - Around 9:00.
- You waited all night to call? I was waiting for the doctors to run some tests.
You weren't there? Well, I'm here now, aren't I? Hallelujah! Ooh.
Um, so, wha what time was your sauna test? [IN UNISON] Around 9:00.
Well, that proves it.
That proves my theory.
She's flayed, just like Billy.
- Flayed? - The Mind Flayer.
He flays people.
Takes over their mind.
Once they do that, they basically become him.
- If there are two flayed - We have to assume there are more.
Heather.
Billy was doing something to her.
[HEATHER WHIMPERS ECHO] She was scared.
She was screaming.
- [SCREAMS] - Bad screams.
- What's a good scream? - Max said - Doesn't matter.
- I'm sorry, I'm lost.
Who is Heather? - She's a lifeguard at the pool.
- Heather Holloway? [BOTH] Tom.
[CAR DOORS SHUT] Seriously? Welcome to my world.
[MIKE SCOFFS] Seat belts.
[INTENSE SYNTH MUSIC PLAYING] [INSECTS BUZZING] - Oh, my God.
Can you not walk so close? - What? Can you not walk so close to me? You stink.
[HOPPER LAUGHS] I get it, I get it.
You're upset, right? 'Cause I, uh I blew up the car? Yeah, with me in it.
Well, I just want to remind you of something, Joyce.
- I am not a mechanic.
- Yeah, clearly.
That's why you should've listened to Alexei.
Oh, right, yeah.
Your new boyfriend, right? Yes.
Every man I talk to from now on has to be my boyfriend.
Yeah, he reminds me a bit of a Russian Scott Clarke.
Oh, here we go.
Maybe you should go on a date.
I don't know, I'm thinking, like, Enzo's? - Whoa.
- What? He's running.
[ALEXEI WHIMPERS, GRUNTS] You son of a bitch! - [ALEXEI MUTTERS IN RUSSIAN] - [HOPPER] Hey! Smirnoff! Get back here! - [ALEXEI CHUCKLES] - Hey! C'mere! [GRUNTING] [HOPPER] Hey, c'mere! [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [ALL PANTING] - [BELL CHIMES] - [LIGHT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR BELL JINGLES] [GRUNTS] [MAN] You all gonna pay for those? [BURPS] [REGISTER BEEPING] So, what are you, some kinda bounty hunter? I'm a cop.
I'm undercover.
[HEAVY METAL PLAYING ON CAR STEREO] [MUSIC STOPS] Oh, hey, Karen, it's Joyce.
Yeah, I I'm just checking on Will.
At the movies? Just keep your mouth shut, all right? [SLURPING LOUDLY] All right, all right, hop in.
Come on, get in.
- Hey! - Hey! You "hey"! You "hey"! This is a police emergency, all right? I need to commandeer your vehicle.
What? As long as there's a a [HOPPER] What is your name, sir? - Todd.
- Todd? - Yeah.
- Todd.
- Todd.
- Todd listen to me.
That man in there, I know he doesn't look it, but he is one of the most dangerous men in the world.
He's, uh - murdered many children.
- What? Yeah, he's a true psychopath.
I tracked him over two state lines.
[JOYCE] Hey, what's going on? Ah, Detective Byers.
Uh this is Todd.
He's agreed to lend us his vehicle to transport our dangerous criminal.
Oh, yes, he very dangerous, uh, forger er.
Yeah.
Uh, child murderer.
- Child murderer? - We should really get going.
Hey, how do I get my car back? - You just call the station.
- What station? - [HEAVY METAL RESUMES] - Ooh, I like the sound of that, Todd! Hey, what station? You're doing the right thing! [TIRES SQUEALING] Hey, what the Hey! Dude! [DUSTIN] I mean, you have to admit, as a feat of engineering alone, this is impressive.
What are you talking about? It's a total fire hazard.
There's no stairs, there's no exit, there's just an elevator that drops you halfway to hell.
They're Commies.
You don't pay people, they cut corners.
To be fair to our Russian comrades, I don't think this tunnel was designed for walking.
Think about it, they developed the perfect system for transporting that cargo.
It all comes into the mall like any old delivery.
And then they load it up onto those trucks and nobody's the wiser.
[STEVE] You think they built this whole mall so they could transport that green poison? I very seriously doubt it's something as boring as poison.
It's gotta be much more valuable, like promethium or something.
What the hell is promethium? It's what Victor Stone's dad used to make Cyborg's bionic and cybernetic components.
You're all so nerdy, it makes me physically ill.
No, no, no.
No, don't lump me in with them.
I'm not a nerd, all right? [ROBIN] Why so sensitive, Harrington? Afraid of losing cool points to a ten-year-old child? No, I'm just saying I don't know jack shit about Prometheus.
[DUSTIN] Promethium.
Prometheus is a Greek mythological figure, but whatever.
All I'm saying is, it's probably being used to make something.
Or power something.
- Like a nuclear weapon? - Totally.
Walking towards a nuclear weapon.
That's great.
- That'd be great.
- But if they're building something, why here? I mean, Hawkins.
Seriously.
Of all places.
At the very best, we're a toilet stop on your way to Disneyland, but maybe that's it.
Maybe it's our very - You think the Russians know? - About - They could.
- So it's connected? - Maybe.
- How? I don't know, but it's [BOTH] Possible.
I'm sorry, is there something you'd like to share with the class? - [STATIC HISSING] - [MAN SPEAKS RUSSIAN ON RADIO] [BOTH] Walkie.
[MAN CONTINUES IN RUSSIAN] [MAN CONTINUES IN RUSSIAN] [IN RUSSIAN] "A trip to China sounds nice.
" If you tread lightly.
" It's the code.
- Wherever that broadcast is coming from - It's close.
And if there's one thing we know about that signal It can reach the surface.
Let's go.
[DOORBELL CHIMES] [DOORBELL CHIMES] [LOW FREQUENCY VIBRATION] Tom? Heather? Jesus, it's freezing.
[SNIFFS] Do you guys smell that? [ALL SNIFFING] Oh.
Oh, God.
More chemicals.
You think they're guzzling this shit? Yeah, either that or they just went on a hell of a cleaning spree.
But last year, Will didn't eat chemicals.
- Did you? - No.
This is something new.
Mr.
Clarke, fifth grade.
Posit.
What happens when you mix chemicals together? [LUCAS AND WILL] You create a new substance.
- What if they're making something? - [MAX] In themselves? I mean, come on, if you drink this crap, it'll kill you.
Yeah, if you're human.
[DISTANT, FAINT PULSING] [NANCY] Blood.
Yesterday, Tom had a bandage on his forehead.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] He was attacked.
Call 91 [GRUNTS] [THUNDERCLAP] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC INTENSIFIES] [DOOR HINGE CREAKS] They must have tied them.
They must have taken them somewhere.
[THUNDERCLAP] Mrs.
Driscoll.
She kept saying "I have to go back.
" [SHRIEKS] What if the flaying, it's taking place somewhere else? There must be a place where all this started, right? A source.
Somewhere he didn't want me to see.
[FAINT SHRIEKING NOISE] If we can find the source, then maybe we can stop him.
Or at least stop it from spreading or doing whatever the hell he's doing with those chemicals.
How do we find it? Mrs.
Driscoll.
If she wants to go back so badly, why don't we let her? [TODD] this guy comes up to me, I'm just pumping gas over here, and he Hey, whoa! Don't cross me right now! - [BELL JINGLES] - [LIGHT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [CASH REGISTER BEEPING] Busy day? You could say that.
Some psycho stole that dude's car.
What else? - What? - What else did he say? This psycho? No offense, but I already went over all this with the cops.
I'm not a cop.
Yeah, no shit, Khrushchev.
[GRUNTS] Oh, shit! [WHIMPERS] [GRIGORI] Don't look at them.
At me.
Tell me about this psycho.
[PANTING] Come on, let's go.
Move it.
[DOORS SLAM] I thought you said this guy was a journalist.
Yeah, he, uh he was.
Was? [BUZZER SOUNDS] [MURRAY] Look at the camera.
The camera, above you to the right.
Identify yourselves.
Jim Hopper, Joyce Byers, Smirnoff.
- Alexei.
- Alexei.
[MURRAY] Surname.
I don't know.
Family name! Yeah, I know.
I told I don't know, okay? Open the damn door! [JOYCE] Hopper.
It's all right.
Don't worry.
He's a little bit eccentric, but he's completely harmless.
- [SHOTGUN COCKS] - [JOYCE GASPS] Name.
[IN RUSSIAN] Get that out of my face, you bald American pig.
[IN RUSSIAN] I may be bald, but you're the one in handcuffs, Soviet scum.
[BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYING] Wait.
[DEVICE BEEPS AND WHINES] [ELECTRIC CRACKLING] [DEVICE WHIRS] [DEVICE BEEPS] [LOUD BEEPING] [IN RUSSIAN] Watch it.
[IN RUSSIAN] Silence, scum.
- How long is this gonna take, because I - No.
- No.
- No.
- No, you do not get to question me.
- [DEVICE BEEPS] You have dragged an enemy of the state into my home as carelessly as a child drags in shit on his shoe.
I will search him until I am satisfied.
[CLEARS THROAT] Jim.
C'mere.
[JOYCE] Just c'mere.
I need to talk to you.
[HOPPER] Yeah, what? - What? - This is not gonna work.
- What do you mean? - He's not eccentric, he's certifiable.
[LOUD BEEPING] - Glass houses, Joyce.
- What? - You know, pot calling the kettle black.
- Oh, come on.
- Excuse me! - What? Do me a favor and move your lovers' quarrel elsewhere.
- Oh, oh, this? - No, no, no.
Not a lovers' quarrel, pal.
Spare me! What is your problem? Please, stop talking! No! We have had a very long day.
We have been shot at, nearly blown up, walked God knows how many miles in a hundred degree heat, stole a car, all while being chased by this gigantic psychopath, all so we could bring him to you.
Because somehow, you're the closest person who speaks Russian, which I can't believe.
But that doesn't matter because, unfortunately, we're here.
So, if you don't mind, put that thing away, stop behaving like a jackass, and ask him what he's doing that's making my magnets fall off my damn fridge! Please.
[DEVICE WHINES] [BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYS LOUDLY] [INDISTINCT MALE VOICE ON PA] Okay, clear.
Clear, come on, let's go.
[ROBIN] Okay, that was close.
- [DUSTIN] Too close.
- Relax.
All right? Relax.
Nobody saw [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [FEMALE VOICE SPEAKING RUSSIAN ON PA] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [STEVE] Shit.
Jesus! - Red Dawn.
- I saw it.
- First floor, northwest.
- Saw what? The comms room.
You saw the comms room? Correct.
- Are you sure? - Positive.
The door was open for a second, and I saw a bunch of lights and machines and shit in there.
That could be a hundred different things.
I'll take those odds.
[SIGHS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [STEVE WHISPERS] All right.
We're gonna move fast, we're gonna stay low.
- Okay? - Okay.
[WOMAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [MAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Shh! Move it.

You want to walk all the way back? Well, we can hang out for a little bit, relax, have a picnic maybe.
Have a picnic? We came here for the radio.
[DUSTIN] This plan is way better.
If I knew Steve could knock out a Russian, that would've been our plan in the first place.
[LOW FREQUENCY PULSING] [MEN SPEAKING RUSSIAN] - but I guess you're - Guys.

At all.
I never have.

[ELECTRICITY CRACKLES] [TOM] She's gone home.
We were hoping you might come back.

Sheesh, do I have to do everything myself? [OMINOUS SYNTH MUSIC PLAYING] [CLEARS THROAT] [LARRY] My friends in state PD, highway patrol, they're all on the lookout.
I got eyes everywhere.
The second he pops up I get a call.
A call? Yes.
A call.
[CHUCKLES] I mean, what more do you people want me to do? We want you to find him.
[SUCKS LIPS] Let me explain something to you.
This man is a moron, okay? He's driving around in a yellow convertible, for Christ's sakes.
He sticks out like a sore thumb.
I will find him.
And, when I do, may I suggest you bring some backup with you this time? - Backup.
- Some comrades.
Since last time, he got the better of you.
[LARRY GRUNTS] - [DOOR WHINES SHUT] - [CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYING] - [LARRY GROANS] - [HISSING NOISE] [RIDE POWERS UP] Please I I didn't mean that.
You You don't need backup.
This man is your fault, your problem.
You're lucky you still breathe.

Please.
I'm sorry.
I I have a bad temper.
I'm going to therapy.
You have one day to find this man for me.
Nod if you understand.
[CHOKING] [PLAYFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [HOPPER] Two Whoppers, extra ketchup, large fry, pack of Marlboro Reds, and one extra-large Slurpee.
Burger King is nowhere near the 7-Eleven, by the way.
Never said it was.
Let's try this again.
Joyce.
Alexei, the generators, what are they powering? And tell him that we know it is not the Starcourt Mall, so he can stop selling us that crap.
[IN RUSSIAN] Those generators you were working on, what are you powering? We know it's not the mall.
[IN RUSSIAN] This tastes like shit strawberry.
- What'd he say? - He says, "It's strawberry.
" I'm sorry? His Slurpee.
[MURRAY] He says it's strawberry.
So what? Hop, he did ask for cherry.
I mean Well, they didn't have cherry.
They didn't have it.
And it doesn't matter, because it all tastes the same, okay? It is sugar on ice.
You tell him that.
Tell him what? You tell him that it all tastes the goddamn same! [MURRAY, IN RUSSIAN] It's all the same.
Sugar on ice.
No difference.
[IN RUSSIAN] Tell that stupid man it is not the same in the slightest, and I would like the cherry I requested.
[MURRAY] It's not the same at all, and he would like - cherry.
- [CHUCKLES] Oh, yeah? You tell him he can forget it.
[IN RUSSIAN] He says forget it.
No cherry.

Yeah, who's been jerking us around for a full day! I get him his cherry Slurpee, then what? He wants a helicopter to charter him to his own private island.
I have dealt with assholes like this my entire life.
[HOPPER] Yesterday in the woods, he could've escaped, - but he didn't.
- [CHUCKLES] He stuck with us.
Why do you think that is? It's because he's scared.
[HOPPER] He's scared.
Not of us, of them.
He's scared of that seven-foot-tall Russian freak who could've killed him just as easily as us.
Smirnoff knows that if he runs back to his comrades without a scratch on him, they're gonna think that he spilled his guts.
So, whether he likes it or not, we are the best chance he's got.
Ooh! [GRUNTS IN PAIN] I give him 30 seconds before he comes knocking on that door, right back into our arms, with a new sense of humility.
- ["NEUTRON DANCE" PLAYS] - I don't wanna take it anymore [LAUGHS GIDDILY] - Jim - Uh I, uh, believe he has started the car.
Hopper.
You know, testing us.
He's just calling my bluff.
'Cause I work so hard to make it every day Woo-ooh I believe he is now driving away.
[GRUMBLES] [SCOFFS] [JOYCE GRUMBLES] Jim.
Jim, move.
- Joyce, Joyce - Move, move, move! Yeah Ooh-ooh, huh Yeah And it's hard to say Just how some things never change And it's hard to find Any strength to draw the line Ooh, I'm just burning doin' the neutron dance I'm just burning doin' the neutron dance [ENGINE SWITCHES OFF] I know there's a pot of gold for me All I've got to do is just believe [MUTTERING IN RUSSIAN] Doin' the neutron dance And I'm just burning I'm sorry, what did he say? He says he likes strawberry, too.
- I'm just burning - In my feet Doin' the neutron dance, woo-hoo [DUSTIN] So, when we set fire to the hub, we drew the Demodogs away so El could close the gate.
But now, for some insane reason, the Russians appear to be trying to reopen it, which just destroys everything we risked our lives for.
By "we", you're including Lucas? Yes, of course.
So, all that shit you told me, Lucas was there? - Yeah.
- My brother, Lucas Charles Sinclair? Yes! I don't believe you.
Wait, so you believe everything about El and the gate and the Demodogs and the Mind Flayer, but you question your brother's involvement? That's correct.
Makes total sense.
- Um, you need help with that? - No.
- Well, I mean, it's taking a while, so - Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.
All right, so if we don't find a more efficient method to stop these fans, we're never gonna find help, and your ice cream buddies are screwed.
Yeah, with that attitude, they are.
Jee-zus! I'm just being realistic.
I mean, we've made it about point-three miles in nine hours.
Then we had to walk three hours down that tunnel, so I'd estimate ten miles back to the elevator, which should take us approximately twelve-and-a-half days.
Did you just do all of that in your head? I'm good with numbers.
Holy shit.
You're a nerd.
Come again? You are a nerd.
Okay, you better take that back, nerd.
Can't put the truth back in the box.
- But it's not the truth.
- Let's examine the facts, shall we? Fact one: you're a math whiz, apparently.
That was a pretty straightforward equation.
Fact number two: you're a political junkie.
Just because I don't agree with Communism as an ideology Fact number three: you love My Little Pony.
And what does My Little Pony have to do with this? Ah, let's recall the ponies' latest adventure, shall we? The evil centaur team and Tirek turns Applejack into a dragon at Midnight Castle, and then Megan and the other ponies have to use Moochick's magic to defeat his rainbow of darkness, saving them from a lifetime of enslavement.
All the pink in the world can't disguise the irrefutable fact that centaurs and castles and dragons and magic are all standard nerd tropes.
Ergo, My Little Pony is nerdy.
Ergo, you, Erica, are a nerd.
And how do you know so much about My Little Pony? Because I'm a nerd.
[ELECTRICITY CRACKLES] [POWERING DOWN NOISE] Let's go nerd.
You [STEVE GROANS] That one stung.
[GASPS FOR AIR] Who do you work for? For the millionth time, I work at Scoops Ahoy! Scoops Ahoy.
[GROANS] [STEVE] What the hell?! Look at my outfit! Look at my outfit! You think I just wear this?! Think I'm a spy in a sailor's uniform? [GROANS] [GRUNTS] How did you get in? [GASPS] I already told you.
I told you before.
[GASPS FOR AIR] My delivery didn't come, and my friends and I, we thought that it was left at the loading dock, so we went in the room, and then it turned into an elevator, and then and then we dropped and then, next thing we know, I open my eyes, and we're in this wonderful facility.
But I swear to God, nobody knows about us, nobody saw us.
You could just let us go, all right? And I'm not gonna tell anybody about this, okay? Shit happens, life goes on.
And, uh ice ice cream.
Ice cream, okay? You guys know what ice cream is.
Everybody loves ice cream.
I don't know if you have Russian ice cream or if that's considered gelato.
I don't know what's what, but whatever you guys want, seriously.
USS Butterscotch, I mean, you gotta try it.
It is out of this world, I'm telling ya! [SOLDIERS LAUGHING] [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] I like this guy! "USS Butterscotch.
" [LAUGHS] [SOLDIERS CONTINUE LAUGHING] [CHUCKLES] [LAUGHTER STOPS] Who do you work for? Oh, come on.
No, no! No, seriously [SOLDIER GRUNTS] [SOLDIERS SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [GRUNTING] Get your hands off me! [YELPS, GRUNTS] Hey Steve? - [DOOR BUZZER SOUNDS] - Steve? Steve? Steve? What did you do to him? What did you do? - [OFFICER GRUNTS] - [ROBIN GROANS] [WHIMPERS] [IN RUSSIAN] Put them in the chairs.
[SOLDIER SPEAKS RUSSIAN] [ROBIN] Don't touch me! Steve [GRUNTS] Steve, wake up.
Steve? [ROBIN GRUNTS, YELPS] What did you do?! [ROBIN GRUNTS] Don't touch him.
[CLICKING TONGUE] Steve? Steve, can you hear me? your friend need a doctor.
Good thing we have the very best.
[OFFICER LAUGHS] [SOLDIERS LAUGH] You are going to regret that, little bitch.
[SPEAKS RUSSIAN] [DOOR BUZZER SOUNDS] Bastards.
Let us outta here! Bastards! Let us out! Let us out! [WATER SPLASHING GENTLY] [OMINOUS SYNTH MUSIC PLAYING] [STATIC HISSING] [MIKE] It can't be good for her to be in there for this long.
Mike, you need to relax.
What if she gets brain damage or something? Oh, shit.
Is that, like, a real thing? No, it's not.
He made it up.
Mike doesn't know what he's talking about.
- Oh, and you do? - No, I Yes, from The Hawkins Post.
I I called a couple days ago about the - [INDISTINCT MALE VOICE ON PHONE] - Yes, yes, um I was just following up to see if anything else had gone missing, or if Okay.
Um, sorry to bother [DIAL TONE SOUNDING] [MAX AND MIKE ARGUE INDISTINCTLY IN BACKGROUND] - [NANCY SIGHS] Who's next? - [JONATHAN] There is no next.
Unless you want to start calling random people's homes.
- It doesn't make sense.
- What part of any of this makes sense? There's a pattern, okay? A consistency to their behavior.
They've been feeding on these chemicals since this started, and and, what, they just stop, out of the blue? Maybe they have all the chemicals they need.
Maybe they've all turned into those things.
But what about the source? I mean, did the Mind Flayer just suddenly stop infecting people? And even if the flayed are monsters now, why can't El find them? Okay, can you guys settle an argument for us? Who do you think should decide El's limits? Mike or Eleven? The way that you frame that is such bullshit.
It's not bullshit, Mike.
This is your whole problem.
And it's also precisely the reason why she dumped your ass.
El dumped you? Yeah, because she is conspiring against me.
She's corrupting her.
No, enlightening her.
[MAX] The fact is, she's not yours.
She's her own person, fully capable of making her own decisions.
She's risking her life for no reason.
For no reason? Mike, the flayed are out there doing God knows what.
- Killing, flaying - Transforming into monsters.
And El's not stupid.
[NANCY] She knows her abilities better than any of us.
- Exactly, thank you.
- And she is her own person.
- Exactly.
- With her own free will.
[MAX] Exactly.
El has saved the world twice, and Mike still doesn't trust her.
You wanna talk about trust, really? After you made Eleven spy on us? - Wait, what? - Oh, she didn't tell you this? - No.
- Your girlfriend used El's powers - to spy on us.
- No, no, no, I did not make her.
It was her idea.
And why are we even talking about this, seriously? Yeah, who cares? - I care.
- Yeah.
I guess girlfriends don't lie, they spy.
We were just joking around.
Wouldn't it've been so funny if I was taking a massive shit or something? - You weren't.
- But what if I was? - Then gross! - Seriously, Mike? I'm just trying to demonstrate how careless Max is with Eleven's powers.
In fact, how careless all of you are.
You're treating her like some kind of machine when she's not a machine, and I don't want her to die looking for the flayed when they've obviously vanished off the face of the Earth.
So can we please just come up with a new plan because I love her and I can't lose her again.
[DOOR OPENING] What's going on? Nothing.
Nothing.
Just a family discussion.
Oh.
I found him.
Found who? [MURRAY] He calls it the key, and this key emits a great energy.
[ALEXEI SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [MURRAY] It requires much strength, power.
[ALEXEI SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [MURRAY] Those houses, like the one you found, they're located near, uh, transformers.
They're stealing from your town's power grid.
Why build this key here? Why are they not doing this in their own backyard? What are they trying to do, blow us to smithereens? [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [CHUCKLES LIGHTLY] [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] There were many of these, uh, keys before in Russia, but they turned out wrong.
[ALEXEI SPEAKING RUSSIAN] They had to come to where the where the, uh Where the what? - I don't understand what he's saying.
- I thought you were fluent.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are my free translation services not good enough for you? Because you can just go ahead and file your complaint right up my ass! What is Smirnoff doing? - He's showing me.
- [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [MURRAY] Oh, okay.
Uh, he says the straw, they're using it to penetrate a hole in a box? [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Okay, sorry, sorry.
[MURRAY] The straw represents the key, which emits a great energy.
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN] They're using this energy to break through a barrier, to open a doorway.
A doorway between worlds.
[ALEXEI SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [MURRAY] But it seems this key was only half the equation.
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Location Location was the other half.
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Oh, what [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] In Hawkins, this door had been opened once.
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN] It was still healing.
Jesus Christ.
So, this door is open now? [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] He says it is opening.
- [CREATURE SHRIEKING] - [FLUTTERING SOUND] [GASPS] - Where are you going? - To call our children.
[GASPS] [IN RUSSIAN] Can we watch Looney Tunes now? Nyet.
[BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYING] [PANTING] [GRUMBLING] - Can I help you with something? - Whiskey.
- You have whiskey? - No, but I do have vodka.
[HOPPER SIGHS] - [HOPPER INHALES SHARPLY] - Oh! If there's a way to start this key, there's gotta be a way to stop it, yeah? Turn it off? - [HOPPER INHALES SHARPLY] - [MURRAY SIGHS] - Right.
- Right? [IN RUSSIAN] The key, is there a way to turn it off? [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] he could turn it off.
Could Edison not turn off a lamp, could Bell not hang up a phone?" Cocky bastard.
"But" But what? [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] But he is now "naked".
Sorry, "exposed".
Compromised.
Hey, I will get you there.
I will get you to your key.
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [LAUGHS] You wanna ask him what the hell's so funny about that? [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] He says he likes your courage.
You remind him of a [CLEARS THROAT] fat Rambo.
[ALEXEI SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [MURRAY] But he says that even thin Rambo couldn't get there.
[ALEXEI SPEAKING RUSSIAN] This key, it is in an underground fortress designed by the greatest Russian minds, guarded by their greatest warriors.
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [MURRAY] Breaking in is impossible.
Jackpot.
[DUSTIN] Oh-ho-ho! Do you even know how to drive? How hard can it be? Max did it.
- [DUSTIN] Aw, come on.
- You seriously thought - they'd just leave keys in there? - There's gotta be a spare.
[ERICA SIGHS] - [ERICA] Hey, Dustin? - Yeah? How big did you say that Demogorgon was? Big.
Nine feet or so.
Why? Found 'em.
Erica? [LOUD ZAPPING] What the hell is that?! A deadly weapon.
Could be useful.
- For what? - What do you think? Taking down Commies, saving your friends.
Thought you were more realistic than that, nerd.
We don't even know where they are, and even if we did, there are a million guards up there with weapons way deadlier than that.
The best thing we can do for them is to get out of here and find help.
Easy with that.
Our chance of surviving, and theirs, rises substantially.
Just trust me on this.
Please? [ENGINE POWERING UP] [ROBIN] Help! [ROBIN'S VOICE ECHOES] Help! - Help! - Hey, would you stop yelling? Steve! Oh, my God! [PANTING] Steve Are Are you okay? My ears are ringing, and I can't really breathe, my eye feels like it's about to pop out of my skull, but, you know, apart from that, I'm doing pretty good.
Well, the good news is that they're calling you a doctor.
[ROBIN CHUCKLES] Is this his place of work? - I love the vibe.
- [ROBIN CHUCKLES] Charming.
Yeah, tell me about it.
So, okay, do you see that table over there to your right? No, your other right.
- Oh.
- Yeah, okay.
- And do you see those scissors? - Uh-huh.
Yeah, well, I think that if we move at the same time, we could get over there, and then maybe I could kick the table and knock them into your lap.
- And I could cut the binds.
- Yeah, and we could get out of here.
- Gotcha.
Okay, yeah, we can do that.
- Yeah.
Those morons.
They left scissors in here? - Yeah, morons.
[LAUGHS] - Total morons.
- Okay.
- Okay, so, on the count of three, we're gonna hop.
- Okay, good, hop on three.
I gotcha.
- All right.
One, two, three.
- Okay, that worked.
- Okay.
- All right.
Uh, let's try again.
- Right.
[BOTH] One, two, three.
- Holy shit, this is gonna work! - We're close.
Ready? Okay, one, two, three.
[BOTH GRUNTING] [BOTH GROANING] [LAUGHING LIGHTLY] It's okay, it's okay.
Don't cry.
Robin.
[ROBIN GIGGLES] Are you laughing? [CONTINUES LAUGHING] - Yeah.
- Jesus! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry.
It's just I can't believe I'm gonna die in a secret Russian base with Steve "The Hair" Harrington.
- It's just too trippy, man.
- We're not gonna die.
We're gonna get out of here, okay? Just You gotta let me just think for a second.
Do you remember, um, Mrs.
Click's sophomore history class? What? Mrs.
Clickity-Clackity.
That's what us band dweebs called her.
- [SIGHS] - It was first period, Tuesdays and Thursdays, so you were always late.
And you always had the same breakfast.
Bacon, egg, and cheese on a sesame bagel.
I sat behind you two days a week for a year.
Mister Funny.
Mister Cool.
The King of Hawkins High himself.
Do you even remember me from that class? [ROBIN CHUCKLES] Of course you don't.
You were a real asshole, you know that? Yeah, I know.
But it didn't even matter.
It didn't matter that you were an ass.
I was still obsessed with you.
Even though all of us losers pretend to be above it all, we still just wanna be popular accepted, normal.
If it makes you feel any better, having those things isn't all that great.
Seriously.
[SIGHS] It just baffles me.
Everything that people tell you is important, everything that people say you should care about, it's all just [CHUCKLES] bullshit.
But I guess you gotta mess up to figure things out, right? I hope so.
I feel like my whole life has been one big error.
[CHUCKLES] Yep.
[LAUGHS] At least it can't get any more messed up than this.
[BOTH CHUCKLE] You know, I wish I'd known you in Click's class.
- Yeah? - Really, I do.
[ROBIN CHUCKLES] Maybe you could've helped me pass the class.
Maybe instead of being here, I'd be on my way to college right now.
And I would have no idea that there were evil Russians beneath our feet, and I would be happily slinging ice cream with some other schmuck.
[BOTH CHUCKLE] Gotta say, though, I liked being your schmuck.
It was fun while it lasted.
It was.
- [BUZZER SOUNDS] - [DOOR OPENS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [CHUCKLES] Where were you two going? [CLICKING TONGUE] Try telling the truth this time, yes? It will make your visit with Dr.
Zharkov less painful.
[WINCES] [CHUCKLES] Wait a second.
Wait.
Hold on.
Okay! Wait, wait, wait! What is that thing? It will help you talk.
Did you even clean that thing?! [SCREAMS] [STATIC HISSING] [GASPING BREATHS] [ELEVEN BREATHES RAPIDLY] [GASPING, PANTING] What's he doing now? [NANCY] And that's not normal, right? Billy staying in his room on the Fourth of July? No, that's not normal.
He wants us to find him.
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.
If we go to Billy, then the rest of the flayed know where we are.
It's a trap, I agree.
We'll be ambushed.
We won't be surprised.
We'll know that they're coming, and we will kick their flayed butts.
You mean El will kick their butts.
[ELEVEN'S VOICE ECHOES] Papa! No.
[TERRY] Rainbow.
Three to the right, four to the left.
Sunflower.
Rainbow.
- [MIKE] It's too risky.
- [NANCY] Yeah, and unnecessary.
Killing the flayed won't stop the Mind Flayer.
We have to find out where it's spreading from.
We have to find the source.
[ELEVEN] Billy knows it.
Billy's been there.
To the source.
- Yeah, but - It's a trap.
I know.
[ELEVEN] We can't go to Billy, but I think there's another way.
A way for me to see where he's been.
[STATIC HISSING] El, I know you think you have to do this, but you don't.
It's just, you've only done this before once.
And your mom, she loved you, and wanted you to know what happened.
And Billy's mind is is sick, diseased.
The Mind Flayer is in him.
He can't hurt me.
Not in there.
We don't know that.
Mike.
I need you to trust me.
Yeah.
Just be careful.
[SHIVERING BREATHS] [ELEVEN EXHALES SHARPLY] [ECHOING] Billy.
Can you hear me? I want to see.
I want to see what happened.
[SUSPENSEFUL SYNTH MUSIC PLAYING] [WHIMPERING] Something's wrong.
[SCREAMS] Stop! No! No! No! No! [DISTORTED ROARING] [GASPING] [BILLY GRUNTING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [DISTORTED SCREAMS] [SQUAWKING] [DISTORTED WAILING] [MIKE, ECHOING] El, are you okay? Are you okay? [SIGHS] [SOFTLY] I'm okay.
What's going on? I'm on a beach.
[LUCAS] Okay, I may be dense, but the last I checked, there weren't any beaches in Hawkins.
What else do you see? [TIDES CRASHING] [SEAGULLS SQUAWKING] [ELEVEN] A woman.
She's pretty.
I I think she's looking at me.
[ECHOING LAUGHTER] [WOMAN] Woo! Yeah! [WOMAN LAUGHS] [WOMAN] You did it! There's a boy.
Did you see that? Yeah, I saw that! That was at least seven feet.
[WOMAN] I don't know what it was, but it almost gave me a heart attack.
Ten more minutes? - Yeah, okay, ten more minutes.
- Okay.
But any longer than that, Dad's gonna be mad, okay? [BOY] Okay! [BOY PANTING] Billy? Watch out for rip currents! I know.
It's Billy.
It's California.
It's a memory.
[SEAGULLS SQUAWKING] [DISTANT RUMBLING] I think I see it.
The source.
[PANTING] [OMINOUS SYNTH MUSIC PLAYING] [THUNDER RUMBLING AND CRASHING] [DIALING ON ROTARY PHONE] [MURRAY] Two minutes, Jim.
It's a secure line, but any longer than that and they could trace you.
Yeah, I want 'em to trace me.
- What? - [HOPPER CLEARS THROAT] [PHONE RINGING] Philadelphia Public Library.
Uh This is Jim Hopper uh police chief, Hawkins.
[HOPPER] I got this number from Dr.
Sam Owens.
What is your identification code? Identification code? You don't know it? You must be joking.
Oh, no, no, I got it, I got it.
[CHUCKLES] I got it.
You wrote it down and kept it in your wallet? "Antique Chariot".
Listen.
[HOPPER] Um, tell Owens that the Russkies are opening the gate.
Now, he'll know what that means.
Not about the Russkies, but about the gate.
Tell him that there's an entrance at Starcourt Mall.
I know how to get in, but I need backup, a lot of backup.
Have him call me back here at 618-625-8313.
Your message will be relayed.
- So, now what? - Now, we, uh we wait.
You compromised me, Jim.
You do realize that, don't you? I'm gonna have to relocate.
- How long do we wait? - As long as it takes.
How can you just sit there being calm? I am not calm! Our kids are in danger! You said they were at the festival! Which is, like, ten minutes from the gate! [SCOFFS] What are you doing? Joyce? What are you doing? [PHONE RINGS] Philadelphia Public Library.
Yes, hello.
Uh, this is, uh, Antique Chariot's partner Wheelbarrow.
I don't think Antique Chariot properly conveyed the urgency of our situation.
What are you doing? Can't just sit around and wait for a call.
- Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to stay calm.
- No.
Don't you dare patronize me! I don't know who you are, if you're some glorified secretary or what, but if you don't wanna lose your job, here's what's gonna happen.
When I hang up, you're gonna get up off your ass, and you're gonna go find Owens and tell him what's going on.
We don't have time to talk about it and neither does he.
He's gotta get to Hawkins, and he's gotta bring his men right now! Do you understand me? Yes, yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
And good day.
It's been exactly one minute, Joyce.
That's one minute too long.
- Alexei.
- [GASPS] [IN RUSSIAN] What's going on? We gotta go.
Vroom, vroom.
Back to Hawkins.
Come on.
[JOYCE] Come on.
Honestly, I don't really feel anything.
Do you? I mean, I I feel fine.
- I feel normal.
- Yeah, I feel I feel fine.
I kinda feel good.
[BOTH CHUCKLING] - Wanna know a secret? - What? I like it, too! [BOTH LAUGH] - I feel good.
- Morons.
They messed up the drug.
They messed it up! - Morons.
Hey, morons! - Morons! - Moron! Mor - Hey! Whoa-oh! Oh, no.
There's definitely something wrong with us.
- Something's wrong.
- [DOOR BUZZER SOUNDS] [ROBIN CHUCKLES] Would now be a good time to tell you that I don't like doctors? Let's try this again, yes? [MURMURS] Who do you work for? Scoops.
[CHUCKLES] Scoops Ahoy.
[GIGGLES] How did you find us? Totally by accident.
[CHUCKLES] [STEVE CHUCKLES] [IN RUSSIAN] More lies.
What is that shiny little toy? [ROBIN] Where you going with that, doc? Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.
Wait! No! Wait! Wait! - Whoa! - There was a code! We heard a code! Code.
What code? "The week is long.
The silver cat feeds when blue meets yellow in the west.
" Blah, blah, blah.
You broadcast that stupid spy shit all over town, and we picked it up on our Cerebro, and we cracked it in a day.
A day! You think you're so smart, but a couple of kids who scoop ice cream for a living cracked your code in a day, and now, people know you're here.
Who knows we are here, little bitch? Uh, well, Dustin knows.
Hey, Steve? - Yeah, Dustin Henderson, he knows.
- Steve! - [STEVE LAUGHS] - Dustin Henderson.
It is your small, curly-haired friend? Oh, curly-haired.
Great hair.
Small.
Kind of like a 'fro.
Yeah.
Where is he? He's long gone, you big asshole.
And he's probably calling Hopper, and Hopper's calling the US cavalry.
[LAUGHS] They're gonna come in here, commando-style, guns a-blazin', and kick your sorry asses back to Russia.
You're gonna be two pieces of toast.
[SNICKERS] Is that so? Yeah.

Building something - Is he talking about the flayed? - He must be.
So, he's building an army, just like we thought.
Yeah, but he's not building this army to spread.
He's building it to stop Eleven.
Last year, El closed the gate on him.
I have a feeling that really pissed him off.
Like, royally.
And the Mind Flayer now knows that she's the only thing that can stop him.
- But if she's out of the way - Game over.
He also said he was gonna kill all of you.
Yeah, well, that's nice.

It's only marijuana.
This isn't funny, okay? I need to know what they did to you.
- Are you gonna die on us? - Boop.
We all die, my strange little child friend.
It's just a matter of how and when.
They're gonna be looking for us up there, so I need you to tell me where you parked your car.
Oh, can we make a pit stop at the food court? - I would kill for a hot dog on a stick.
- Ooh! All right.
Yeah, food.
Yes, you can have as much food as you want, but only if you tell me where your car is parked.
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh? The car's off the board.

The Russians, they took the keys.

- [METAL CLANGING IN MOVIE] - [DOC GASPS] [DOC] The temporal displacement occurred exactly 1:20 - You two, sit.
- No, no, no! These seats are too close! - Dude, these seats blow.
- Then don't watch the movie.
- We wanna watch it.
- Then watch it! - Shh! - Shh! Sorry.
Whatever you do, don't go anywhere.
- Fine, Dad.
- [ROBIN SNICKERS] [DOC] The appropriate question is "When the hell are they?" You see, Einstein has just become - the world's first time traveler! - Sorry.
Sorry.
- [DOC] I sent him into the future! - [DUSTIN SIGHS] Okay, it's official.
I'm never having kids.
- What are we doing here? - We're laying low.
Cooling off.
Like Oswald.
Oswald was found in a theater and shot to death.
A week later.
The point is, his plan didn't work.
Only because it was a setup.
- What? - He was just a patsy.
- Tell me you're joking.
- Shh! [ERICA AND DUSTIN] Shh! We need to get outta here.
All right, you watch Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
- Make sure they don't go anywhere.
- Where are you going? To find us a ride.
[DOC] Look out! [DELOREAN ZAPPING] [BRAKES SCREECHING] [MARTY] Doc - What's happening? - I have no idea.
[MARTY] Are you telling me that you built a time machine [ALEXEI SPEAKING RUSSIAN] - What's he saying? - He's showing me the location of the key to turn off the machine.
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN] - Sorry, "keys".
Two keys.
- [ALEXEI SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Two-man rule.
- Two-man rule? - Yeah, two men, two keys, like a nuclear launch.
But, uh, to retrieve the keys, there is a vault.
- [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] - And to open the vault, you need to enter Planck's constant.
- Planck's what? - Planck's constant.
- It's a very famous number.
- All right, so we get the keys, and then we turn the machine off.
That's what he says.
All right, well, that shouldn't be too hard.
We can do this.
Joyce, did you hear the part where he said the place was like an impenetrable fortress? Yeah, but there has to be a way in.
Yeah, there is.
Our military.
- Who are coming.
- Well, we don't know that anymore because you yelled at them like it was a parent-teacher conference, and then you hung up on them, so we don't know what the hell's going on, because now we're Wait, wait, what are we do Oh! Wait, that's right! We're on our way to rescue our children from the big, bad Fourth of July celebration! You know what, if you can't handle this, then just turn around and drop me off first.
What are you gonna do? You gonna walk back to Hawkins? I will do anything if it gets me away from you! Children! Children! Children! This interminable bickering was amusing at first, but it's getting very stale and we've still got a long drive ahead of us.
So, why don't you two cut the horseshit and get to the part where you admit your sexual feelings for one another? - Whoa! - You are way off base, buddy! Oh, spare me, spare me, spare me! Yes, yes, he's a brute.
I know.
Probably reminds you of a bad relationship, and, gosh, you'd really like a nice man to settle down with, but, admit it, you're real curious to know what he's like in the sack.
And you.
Ha! Well, you're just a big manbaby who'd rather act tough than show his true feelings, because the last time you opened your heart, you got hurt.
Owie.
And now, rather than admit these feelings, you're dancing around one another with this mind-numbing and frankly boorish mating ritual.
So, please, for my sake, either quit your bickering, or pull over, tear off those clothes, and get it over with already! [GASPS] [DEEP SIGH] [IN RUSSIAN] What was that? [IN RUSSIAN] I told them they should have sex.
They have not had sex? No.

Go get me a washcloth and a bowl.
- A bowl? - Lucas.
- Go.
- [STAMMERS] Okay.
[GROANS] [NANCY] What did that thing look like to you? Like that thing in the hospital, only bigger.
Yeah, a lot bigger.
Like, Tom and Bruce, they merged to become one, right? And And Driscoll kept saying how she needed to go back to the source Wait, you think Driscoll's in there? Maybe.
And And And maybe Heather and Janet, too, and God knows who else.
I don't know how we're gonna kill this thing, but if we do - We kill all the flayed.
- And we end this.
Maybe.
All I know is we need El.
[LUCAS] Bowl Bowl Bowl - Why wouldn't it be with the cereal? - I don't know.
What else do you use a bowl for? I I don't know.
[LUCAS SIGHS] Oh, shit.
Satan's Baby.
You ever shot one of these suckers? No.
Is it sweet? - That's an understatement.
- [MAX] That doesn't look like a bowl.
Nah, it's way better.
There is a reason this warning label says "18 or older".
This sucker is filled with 150 grains of black powder.
AKA gunpowder.
Strap two of these together, and it's bigger than an M-80.
Five of them, we've got ourselves a stick of dynamite.
You wanna kill that thing with fireworks? Do you have a better idea? Uh, yeah.
Eleven.
Against that thing? She's gonna need some backup.
- Oh, my God.

You're gonna have an awesome scar.
You'll look even more badass.

It's just, being broken up, it's been hard.
[DISTORTED RADIO CHATTER] And I like that you and Max are friends now.
It's just, I was jealous at first, and and angry.
And that's why I said all that stupid stuff.
And it's like I wanted you all to myself.
And now I realize how unfair that is.
And selfish.
And, like I'm sorry.
I just, like, I've never felt like this, you know, with anyone before and [SIGHS] You know, they do say it makes you crazy.
What makes you crazy? You never You never heard that term You know, like the phrase, like "blank makes you crazy", like the word - "Girlfriends"? - No, no, no, no, not not girlfriends.
- "Boyfriends".
- No! No, no, not boyfriends either.
- It's like It's like a feeling or - [SOFTLY] A feeling Yeah, like something Like, old people say it to each other sometimes.
- Old people? - Yeah.
What I wanna say is that I just I know that I - [DUSTIN SPEAKING VIA RADIO, GARBLED] - [STATIC POPPING] [DUSTIN, DISTORTED VIA RADIO] I repeat this is a code red! - [SCORE FROM BACK TO THE FUTURE PLAYS] - Dustin? Mike? - [MIKE] Dustin! - Mike! Oh, my God, you have to listen.
I know I've been MIA, and I'm sorry, it's not because I'm mad.
I mean, I actually was mad, but it's also because I was trapped underground in a secret Russian base.
[GARBLED RADIO AUDIO] Dustin, you're going way too fast.
I can't understand you.
I know that sounds insane, but the Russians have infiltrated Hawkins! The goddamn Russians! And now they're using to open the gate.
Dustin, you're you're breaking up.
And now they're after us and we don't have a way out of here, so I need you to come and get us.
Can Nancy drive? [GARBLED RADIO AUDIO] Dustin, you're cutting out.

Guess we'll have to go to plan B.
Plan B? What's plan B? [FILM SCORE CRESCENDOS] Where are they? That's amazing.
So, like, I wasn't totally focused in there or anything, but I'm pretty sure that mom was trying to bang her son.
Wait, wait, the hot chick was Alex P.
Keaton's mom? Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
But they're the same age.
No, but he went back in time.
[SNICKERS] Then why is it called Back to the Future? He has to go back to the future because he's in the past.
So, the future is actually the present, which is his time.
Wh What? No, no, it's my turn.
You've had enough.

[MIKE AND MAX] What? It's like Carpenter's The Thing.
The original is a classic, no question about it.
But the remake [SLURPING LOUDLY] [SATISFIED SIGH] [SMACKING LIPS] Sweeter, bolder better.
You're insane.
So, you prefer the original Thing? What? No, I'm not talking about The Thing, I'm talking about New Coke.
It's the same concept, dude.
Uh, actually, it's not the same concept.
It is the same concept.
- No, it's not.
- [YELLS] Yes, it is.
Hey.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Did you find him? [LUCAS] The movies? Dustin's so freaked out about the gate, he decides to go watch a movie? Yeah, makes total sense.
You're positive he said "gate" and not "great"? Yeah, like, "This movie I'm watching is great.
" Sounded like "gate".
Which would explain how the Mind Flayer's still alive.
- Yeah, we just have to shut it again.
- Then the monster dies.
But if not, we always have Lucas' fireworks.
Keep mocking my plan, Max.
Keep mocking it.
I wanna hear you say it again, because you keep doubting me.
You keep doubting me! - [MAX] Ridiculous.
- [LUCAS] Will? We're gonna prove 'em wrong, right? [EERIE SYNTH MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREECHING] [STEVE GROANS] The ceiling stopped spinning for me.
Is it still spinning for you? Holy shit.
No.
You think we puked it all up? Maybe.
Ask me something.
[IN RUSSIAN ACCENT] Interrogate me.
Okay.
Interrogate you.
Sure.
Um When was the last time you, uh, peed your pants? Today.
What? When the Russian doctor took out the bone saw.
[LAUGHS] Oh, my God.
It was just a little bit, though.
Yeah, it's definitely still in her system.
[LAUGHS] [GROANS] [ROBIN] Oh - All right, my turn.
- Okay.
Hit me.
Have you ever been in love? Yep.
Nancy Wheeler.
First semester, senior year.
[IMITATES GUNSHOT, CHUCKLES] Oh, my God.
She's such a priss.
[STEVE] Hm.
Turns out, not really.
[SCOFFS] Are you still in love with Nancy? - No.
- Why not? I think it's because I found someone who's a little bit better for me.
[CHUCKLES] It's crazy.
Ever since Dustin got home, he's been saying, "You know, you gotta find your Suzie.
You gotta find your Suzie.
" Wait, who's Suzie? It's some girl from camp, I guess his girlfriend.
To be honest with you, I'm not 100% sure she's even real.
But that's not that's not really the point.
That doesn't matter.
The point is, this girl, you know, the one that I like, it's somebody that I didn't even talk to in school.
And I don't even know why.
Maybe 'cause Tommy H.
would've made fun of me or I wouldn't be prom king.
It's stupid.
I mean, Dustin's right, it's all just a bunch of bullshit anyways.
Because, when I think about it, I should've been hanging out with this girl the whole time.
First of all, she's hilarious.
She's so funny.
I feel like, this summer, I have laughed harder than I have laughed in a really long time.
And she's smart.
Way smarter than me.
You know, she can crack, like, top secret Russian codes and You know? She's honestly unlike anyone I've ever even met before.
Robin? [TAPPING ON STALL] Robin, did you just OD in there? No.
[SIGHS] I am still alive.
[DEEP SIGH] [ROBIN] The floor's disgusting.
Yeah, well, I already got a bunch of blood and puke on my shirt, so What do you think? About? This girl.
She sounds awesome.
She is awesome.
And what about the guy? I think he's on drugs, and he's not thinking straight.
Really? 'Cause I think he's thinking a lot more clearly than usual.
He's not.
Look he doesn't even know this girl.
And if he did know her, like like really know her, I don't think he'd even want to be her friend.
No, that's not true.
No way is that true.
Listen to me, Steve.
It's shocked me to my core, but I like you.
I really like you.
But I'm not like your other friends.
And I'm not like Nancy Wheeler.
Robin, that's exactly why I like you.
[ROBIN SCOFFS] Do you remember what I said about Click's class? About me being jealous and, like, obsessed? Yeah.
It isn't because I had a crush on you.
It's because she wouldn't stop staring at you.
Mrs.
Click? [CHUCKLES] Tammy Thompson.
I wanted her to look at me.
But she couldn't pull her eyes away from you and your stupid hair.
And I didn't understand, because you would get bagel crumbs all over the floor.
And you asked dumb questions.
And you were a douchebag.
And And you didn't even like her and I would go home and just scream into my pillow.
But Tammy Thompson's a girl.
[SOFTLY] Steve.
Yeah? Oh.
Oh.
Holy shit.
Yeah.
Holy shit.
Steve did you OD over there? No, I just, uh just thinking.
Okay.
I mean, yeah.
Tammy Thompson, you know, she's cute and all, but I mean, she's a total dud.
She is not.
Yes, she is.
She wants to be, like, a singer.
She wants to move to, like, Nashville and shit.
- She has dreams.
- She can't even hold a tune.
She's practically tone-deaf.
Have you heard her? - [ROBIN CHUCKLES] - All the time.
[SINGING ATONALLY] You see me now tonight - Shut up.
- You see me - She does not sound like that.
- She sounds exactly - That's a great impersonation of her.
- She does not.
You sound like a Muppet.
She sounds like a Muppet.
She sounds like a Muppet giving birth.
[BOTH LAUGHING] [SINGS LIKE KERMIT] And if you could hold me tight [BOTH SING ATONALLY] We'll be holding on forever - Exactly.

What the hell? [BOTH LAUGH] [INTENSE SYNTH MUSIC PLAYING] [CREATURE SHRIEKS WEAKLY] [MONSTROUS SCREECHING] [CHEERING AND LAUGHING] [ALEXEI, IN RUSSIAN] And why all this? If I just turn the keys, it's like turning off a car.
But then the car still works, does it not? [IN RUSSIAN] Yes.
And do you want the car to still work or do you want it to explode? I want the car to explode.
Good.
Then do this.
Just make sure you are nowhere near it when it does.
It is not pretty.
Turns people into dust.
And then It's over.
[CHUCKLES] And I become an American citizen and join in the fun, yes? Who said you had to be an American to join the fun? [CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD CHEERING] [IN RUSSIAN] It doesn't get more American than this, my friend.

They have been designed to present the illusion of fairness! But it's all a scam, a trick, to put your money in the rich man's pocket.
That, my dear friend, is America.

It's their fault.
True, yeah.
Totally true.
It's absolutely our fault.
I don't understand what happened to that car.
El has superpowers.
- [ROBIN] I'm sorry? - Superpowers.
She threw it with her mind.
- C'mon, catch up.
- That's El? - Who's El? - I'm sorry, who are you? - I'm Robin.
I work with Steve.
- She cracked the top secret code.
Yeah, which is how we found out about the Russians.
Russians? Wait, what Russians? - The Russians! - Those were Russians? - Some of them.
- What are you talking about? - Didn't you hear our code red? - Yeah.
- Couldn't understand what you were saying.
- Goddamn low battery.
How many times do I have to tell you with the low battery? Well, everything worked out, didn't it? - Worked out? We almost died.
- Yeah, but we didn't, did we? - [STEVE] It was pretty damn close.
- [LUCAS] Okay, Russians? As in, they're working for the Russian government? - [ELEVEN PANTING] - [DUSTIN] What are you not comprehending? Am I not speaking English? - We have a full-blown Red Dawn situation.

----------
1 - Still nothing? - Nothing.
Food court? You sure they said food court? I'm sorry, have my translation skills been letting you down? We don't know it's your kids.
Yes, we do.
- What is that? - There's something in there.
- No! - Jesus Christ.
Keep her talking.
Keep her awake, okay? Jesus Christ.
Hey, hey, hey.
Stay awake, stay awake.
Let's get her on this side, on this side.
- Easy, easy, easy, easy.
- It's, uh You know, it's not actually that bad.
There was a The goalie on my soccer team, Beth Wildfire, this other girl slid into her leg, and the bone came out of her knee, - six inches or something, it was insane.
- Robin.
- Yeah? - You're not helping.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
All right, El? This is gonna hurt like hell, okay? - Okay.
- Need you to stay real still.
Here, you're gonna want to bite down on this, okay? Jesus Christ.
Holy shit.
Holy shit.
Do it.
Okay.
Oh, shit.
- Jonathan! - Stop talking! - Goddamn it! - No! Stop it! Stop! Stop! I can do it.
I can do it.
God! God! The Mind Flayer, it built this monster in Hawkins, to stop El, to kill her and pave a way into our world.
And it almost did.
That was just one tiny piece of it.
How big is this thing? It's big.
- Thirty feet, at least.
- Yeah.
It sorta destroyed your cabin.
Sorry.
Okay, so, just to be clear, this this big fleshy spider thing that hurt El, it's some kind of gigantic weapon? - Yes.
- But instead of, like, screws and metal, the Mind Flayer made its weapon with melted people.
- Yes, exactly.
- Yeah, okay.
I Yeah, I'm just making sure.
Are we sure this thing is still out there, still alive? El beat the shit out of it, but, yeah, it's still alive.
But if we close the gate again We cut the brain off from the body.
And kill it.
Theoretically.
Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo! Okay, this is what Alexei called "the hub".
Now, the hub takes us to the vault room.
Okay, where's the gate? Right here.
I don't know the scale on this, but I think it's fairly close to the vault room, maybe 50 feet or so.
More like 500.
What, you're just gonna waltz in there like it's commie Disneyland or something? I'm sorry, who are you? Erica Sinclair.
Who are you? Murray Bauman.
Listen, Mr.
Bunman, I'm not trying to tell you how to do things, but I've been down in that shithole for 24 hours.
And with all due respect, you do what this man tells you, you're all gonna die.
I'm sorry, why is this four-year-old speaking to me? Um, I'm ten, you bald bastard! - Erica! - Just the facts! She's right.
You're all gonna die, but you don't have to.
Excuse me.
- Sorry, may I? - Please.
Okay, see this room here? This is a storage facility.
There's a hatch in here that feeds into their underground ventilation system.
That will lead you to the base of the weapon.
It's a bit of a maze down there, but between me and Erica, we can show you the way.
You can show us the way? Don't worry, you can do all the fighting and the dangerous hero shit, and we'll just be your navigators.
No.
Nope.
Well, that settles it.
He's gonna die.
They're gonna die.
Yep, most likely.
You guys survived.
Barely.
We could've really used you guys down there.
Could've used you up here, too.
Yeah, man.
We missed you, dude.
Yeah.
Big-time.
I missed you guys, too.
Big-time.
Please don't cry, nerds.
- Erica.
- Keep saying my name, see what happens.
Hey, heads up.
You can navigate, just from someplace safe.
- It's not that simple.
- The signal won't reach.
Not with this.
You need something with a high enough frequency band to relay with the Russians' radio tower.
But for that to work, you need someone who has both seen their comms room and has access to a super-powered handcrafted radio tower, one preferably already situated at the highest point in Hawkins.
Oh, wait.
That's me.
If you want us to navigate, you got us.
But we need a head start.
And a car.
Oh, man, now this this is what I'm talkin' about! - "Toddfather"? - Oh, screw Todd! Steve's her daddy now.
Did you just talk about yourself in the third person? - Did he just call himself daddy? - All right, where are we going? - Weathertop.
- Weather-what? - Just drive.
- Okay.
Jesus! Bottom lock, second-to-top lock, third-to-top lock, top lock.
Listen to me, I need to end this, but I will be back before you know it, okay? - I don't know, Mom.
- No, listen.
You're gonna be safe there.
It's It's far away from all this.
You just stick close to your brother and and do whatever he says.
No matter what.
Okay? I'm not worried about me, Mom, I'm worried about you.
Oh, honey, I'm gonna be fine.
Okay? I'm gonna be fine.
Okay, Mom.
Okay, Mom.
That's enough.
- I'm gonna be fine.
- Okay.
Mom, I can't breathe.
- My battery's low, but - You're suffocating me.
it will recharge.
I know it will, kid.
I know.
I can fight.
Better than any of us.
But right now, I need you safe.
This thing is after you.
It's not after me.
Do you understand? Hey I need you to understand.
Okay? Hey.
We should probably go.
Mike? Be careful.
What? It's a two-man operation.
Two! - Yeah, well, change of plans.
- Change of plans? Yeah.
Will you explain it to him, please? We have two options here, Jim.
We can turn the machine off, or we can explode it.
- Oh, yeah, says who? - Says the man who built it! - Yeah, and we wanna explode it! - Or else our heroic efforts will be for naught! This is a three-man operation, Jim, not two.
Yeah, three.
El, you're bleeding.
Are you okay? Yeah.
- Here.
- Okay.
Here.
Lay down.
- What's wrong? - I don't I don't know.
You can't be serious.
Come on! Didn't your mom just buy this car? Yes.
I'm sure it's fine.
- Did you leave the lights on? - No.
- Do we have gas? - Yes! - Come on! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Just stop, stop! Pop the hood.
- What the hell? - What? The ignition cable's gone.
Back in the mall! Back in the mall! - Go! Go, go, go! - Be careful! Go! Go! Go, go, go! So then I yank those cables like I'm pulling weeds.
- And that'll set off the alarm - According to Alexei, may his soul rest in peace.
Which should give you two an opening to retrieve the keys from the vault.
And then we just follow the map to the observation room, turn the key - Kaboom, we blow this sucker sky-high.
- Yeah.
And then, once the rift is closed, we escape back through the vents.
Right under their commie noses.
Then home free.
Uh Oh, God, just because it wasn't your plan doesn't mean it was a bad plan.
I didn't say it was a bad plan.
You made a noise.
- I did not make a noise.
- You did too.
I really think it's disrespectful What is up with you and noises? Children! Children! It is a good plan.
A solid B, which is laudable, given the situation and time constraints.
Dare I say, if it all goes right they'll never even know we were here.
Stop right there! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Documents, important documents for the Lieutenant-Comrade! He called us, last minute.
Pardon our sloppy appearance.
Lieutenant? What Lieutenant? Lieutenant Molotov? Oh, shit.
Jim This is crazy.
- Oh, my God.
- Jim, I This I had it under control.
Yeah, sure you did.
What are you doing? I'm improvising.
Your love Liftin' me higher Jesus, how far is this place, man? Relax, we're almost there.
Suzie must be pretty special, huh? I mean, if you built this thing and lugged it all the way to the middle of nowhere just to talk to her? I mean, nobody's scientifically perfect, but Suzie's about as close to being perfect as any human could possibly be.
She sound made-up to me.
She sound made-up to you? - Why are you hesitating, Steve? - I'm I'm I'm not! I'm not! I think she sounds real.
You know, totally, absolutely real.
Left.
Turn left.
- There's not a road here.
- Turn left now! Jesus! Hang on! Higher and higher Whoa! Henderson, where are we going?! Up! Whoa! Liftin' me higher - Oh, Jesus! - We're not gonna make it! Yes, we are.
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby! Come on! Come on.
Come on.
Come on! Guess the Toddfather has its limitations.
Scoops Troop, do you copy? Scoops Troop, do you copy? Scoops Troop, do you copy? Scoops Troop, I repeat, do you copy? We're trapped in the mall and in need of emergency transportation.
Scoops Troop, do you copy? Billy has found us.
He has disabled our car and we are trapped in the mall.
Repeat: Billy has disabled our car and we are trapped in the mall.
- Scoops Troop - You're gonna kill him, aren't you? This is just a precaution, okay? And not just against Billy.
If he knows we're here, so does the Mind Flayer.
Scoops Troop, I repeat, we are in need of emergency transportation.
Do you copy? Scoops Troop, do you copy? No chance that thing'll drive, right? - Steve, do you copy? - We don't need it to drive.
Dustin! We just need the ignition cable.
Push! Shit! Let me try.
El I can do it.
Can I help? Picking up.
Do I know you? New arrivals.
Landed last night.
Say goodbye to sunlight.
Who needs sunlight when we have one another, comrade? Indeed, comrade! And a bottle of Stolichnaya.
Why are you talking so much? He was nice.
- He was nice? - He was a nice guard.
Yeah, I mean, we should probably invite him over after all this is done.
Yeah, I can bake him a casserole.
Get a six-pack, share some laughs.
You know, have a drink.
Ugh.
Anyone wanna trade jobs? Bald Eagle, do you copy? Bald Eagle, I repeat, this is Scoops Troop, do you copy? Yes, I copy.
Call sign? Bald Eagle.
Please repeat.
- Bald Eagle.
This is Bald Eagle! - Copy that.
Good to hear your voice, Bald Eagle.
What's your 20? We reached the vent.
I'll contact you when I need you.
Until then, silence.
Roger that, Bald Eagle.
This is Scoops Troop, going radio silent.
10-10, over.
I hate children.
- Remember, if anyone says anything, just - Smile and nod.
Good luck.
Push! All right, great.
All right, now, all the way.
Ready? Three, two, one Push! Told you.
Physics.
How do we get it open? Uh, there should be a latch.
Check under the wheel.
- You see it? - I don't know, hold on.
What's she doing? El.
Are you okay? - Do you see it? - I don't know.
It should be right here.
Distributor, distributor Mike.
Got it.
Nancy! Come on! We just found them like this.
The American.
It's taking too long.
- It's fine.
- No, it's not.
It is not.
She could've died back there.
She almost did.
Well, she's safe now.
She's on her way to Murray's.
That thing won't find her, not before we kill it.
Hey.
This isn't the way this is supposed to work, all right? You're supposed to say, "Yes, I told you so.
That's why we needed to go back to the kids.
" Oh, yeah, and then you say something like "Yeah, well, it's really hard to listen when you make everything sound like it's the end of the goddamn world.
" You know I think, despite everything, I mean, despite the arguing, I think we make a pretty good team.
Well, we made it this far, didn't we? Yeah.
We did.
We did.
So, uh did I get the job or what? Ah, come on.
Detective Byers.
It has a ring, doesn't it? It's kinda hard to serve in a town where you don't live, Detective.
You're still moving outta here.
I mean, that is the plan, right? Eh, we'll see how it goes.
"How it goes"? How what goes? You know, if if we actually do make it out of here, we we deserve to celebrate, right? Yeah.
I mean yes.
Absolutely.
I hear Enzo's is pretty good.
What do you say, Friday, eight o'clock? Uh, El likes to watch Miami Vice on Fridays.
It It starts at 10:00, so I I can't be out late on a Friday.
Okay, well, how about 7:00, then? 7:00? Enzo's, Friday, I meet you there? No, you pick me up.
Picking you up, 7:00 p.
m.
Friday.
Yeah, it's a date.
Just for clarification, just because I I mean, just If When you say "date", just so that we're crystal clear, - so there's no confusion Yeah? - Yeah, Hop? Stop talking or I'm gonna change my mind.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Scoops Troop, this is Hm.
Bald Eagle.
I've reached another junction.
- This is what? - The fourth junction.
All right, so if memory serves, this is right after the My Little Pony thesis.
- We went left, so he has to go right.
- Right.
Fly right, Bald Eagle.
- Fly right.
- Roger that, flying right.
Little shit.
What's the My Little Pony thesis? Don't get him started.
- Get him started? Just tell me - Hey, guys? Griswold Family, this is Scoops Troop! Do you copy? Over! Griswold Family, I repeat, this is Scoops Troop.
Do you Griswold Family, do you copy? Do you copy?! Griswold Family, this is Scoops Troop.

- Wait, Robin! Stay in touch.
Got it.
Bald Eagle, this is Scoops Troop.
What's your 20? I told you, radio silence! Yeah, but we have a problem.
What kind of problem? It's turned away.
If we go up the stairs now, we'll make it.
- No way, not with El's leg.
- We have to try.
There's another way to get out.
Through the Gap.
Okay.
Now.
Bald Eagle has landed.
Repeat.
Bald Eagle has landed.
Okay.
Come on, how much longer? I don't know, I've never done this before! Okay.
Okay, okay! Get ready, lovebirds, you're almost up to bat.
Oh, shit.
- What are you doing? - Don't worry.
Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Let's go.
Let's go.
Did Mikhail send for you? - All right.
- Okay.
- Give me the code.
- Okay.
Six-six-two, six-oh-eight, oh-oh-four.
Uh again? Six-six-two, six-oh-eight, oh-oh-four.
Murray? Your goddamn code is wrong.
What? Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure.
Well, I I suppose it could be wrong.
How could it be wrong? The code is a number, a famous number.
Planck's constant I I thought I knew it.
Planck's constant.
- You know it? - Not by heart.
You? I'm not a nerd, nerd.
He told me it was Planck's constant, which I know.
Why would I need him to give me a number I already know? What are you doing? Go, go, go! - Shit.
- Get the car started.
Go! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Come on.
- Come on.
- We gotta go! Come on! We gotta go! Are you okay? Ask me tomorrow? Oh, shit! Get in! - Go, go, go, go! - Go, go, go! Suzie, do you copy? Suzie, do you copy? Suzie, do you copy? This is Suzie.
I copy.
- Suzie! - Dusty-bun? "Dusty-bun"? Where have you been? I'm so, so sorry.
I I've been really busy uh, trying to save the world from Russians and monsters.
Of course you have.
Get the goddamn number already! Who was that? It was Uh, I don't know, actually.
I think it was just some interference.
So, why don't we, uh, change frequency to 14.
158? Copy that, shifting frequency.
Standby.
- Dusty-bun, you copy? - I copy, Suzie-poo.
It sounds much better now, thanks.
- Suzie.
- Okay, so, listen, do you know Planck's constant? Do you know the Earth orbits the sun? Okay, so I know it starts with two sixes, and then a W-What is it? Okay, let me just be clear on this.
I haven't heard from you in a week, and now you want a mathematical equation that you should know so you can save the world? Suzie-poo, I promise, I will make it up to you as soon as possible.
You can make it up to me now.
- What? - I want to hear it.
- Not right now.
- Yes, now, Dusty-bun.
Suzie-poo, this is urgent.
Yes, yes, you're saving the world, I heard you the first time, but Ged is also saving Earthsea and he's about to confront the shadow, so this is Suzie, signing off.
Wait, wait, wait! Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Shit.
Turn around Look at what you see In her face The mirror of your dreams Make believe I'm everywhere Given in the light Written on the pages is The answer to A never-ending story Reach the stars Fly a fantasy Dream a dream And what you see will be Rhymes that keep their secrets will Unfold behind the clouds And there upon a rainbow is The answer to a never-ending story Story Planck's constant is 6.
62607004.
You just saved the world.
Gosh, I miss you, Dusty-bun.
And I miss you more, Suzie-poo.
I miss you more, multiplied by all the stars in our galaxy.
No, I miss you Enough.
- Shit! - Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! It's turning around.
- What? - It's turning around! Maybe we wore it out.
I don't think so.
Hold on.
Hey! Everybody out.
Everybody out! Hey.
You ready to end this? In here.
In here.

But then on July Fourth, everything changed.
A terrible tragedy struck this small town.
But this was not this small town's first brush with tragedy.
Mysterious deaths, government cover-ups, a bizarre chemical leak.
Is it all linked? All a vast conspiracy? The fault of a disgraced, corrupt mayor? Or is something more going on in the heartland? Can a town itself be cursed? Some believe a rise in Satanism is to blame.
To find out, tune in tonight at 8:00 p.
m.
for "Horror in the Heartland" on Cutting Edge.
You put your mom down as a reference? Yeah.
Why not? She's, like, super well-respected.

Classics.
You start Monday.
You start never.
Will you just, um Will you give us a minute? Why? Steve.
All right, you have to understand, Keith, I know his taste is a bit pedestrian, but the dingus has other qualities.
He's a douchebag of the highest order, Robin.
He was a bit of a prick to us in high school, I'll grant you that, but he remains a total chick magnet.
Yeah, okay, and this is relevant to me how? Uh, Earth to Keith.
The ladies will come in just to see him.
They'll come in in droves.
Droves, Keith.
We sold so much ice cream, they had to get a second shipment in from Michigan.
Goddamn Michigan, Keith.
And these ladies These ladies are hot.
They're so very hot.
And there are too many of them for little Steve.
He needs assistance.

Turn around Look at what you see In her face The mirror of your dreams Rhymes that keep their secrets Will unfold behind the clouds Wait, did we get that verse right? It's "unfold behind the clouds"? Yeah, but you're butchering it, so could you please stop? So then join in, Dusty-bun.
Yeah, come on, Dusty-bun, why don't you join us? You guys are so funny, you should be on Carson.
- Can't we just hear your rendition? - No.

No way.
It's reserved for Suzie's ears and Suzie's ears alone.
Turn around Look at what you see In their face The mirror of your dreams Shut up, you guys.
Rhymes that keep their secrets Stop! You guys, please, shut up.
Whoa, dude.
That's the donation box.
I know.
I'll just use yours when I come back.
I mean, if we still wanna play.
Yeah, but what if you want to join another party? Not possible.
Is that everything? I guess so.
Seventeen years of my life packed up in one day.
What if I just don't let you go? I think the new owners might kick us out.
You could stay in our basement.
Your dad'd love that.
We could hide you in a tent, like El.
Hey.
It's gonna be okay.
As a wise man once said we've got shared trauma.
So what's a little more, right? What's a little more? They'll come back.
I know they will.
Thanks.
- You packed your walkie, right? - Yes.
Because you know that I'm gonna steal Cerebro from Dustin and call you so much, you're gonna have to turn it off, right? Did you talk to your mom? About Thanksgiving? Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got the okay.
I'll be there.
And then I was thinking maybe you could come up here for Christmas.
And Will, too.
You can come before or after Christmas, or whatever Mrs.
Byers wants, but I was thinking Christmas Day could be super fun, because we'd all have cool new presents to play with and, uh Sorry, that made me sound like a seven-year-old.
I like presents, too.
Yeah, cool.
Yeah.
I like I like presents, too.
Cool.
Mike? Yeah? Remember that day at the cabin, you were talking to Max? Um I don't think I follow.
You talked about your your feelings, your heart.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, that.
Man, that was so long ago.
Um That was really heat of the moment stuff, and we were arguing and I don't really remember What did I say, exactly? Mike I love you, too.
Donation box? Uh, yeah, sure.
What is that? Uh It It's the speech Hop wrote for you and Mike.
Speech? Yeah.
You know, the heart-to-heart.
He never talked to you, did he? Can I read? "There's something I've been wanting to talk to you both about.
" I know this is a difficult conversation, but I care about you both very much.
And I know that you care about each other very much.
And that's why it's important that we set these boundaries moving forward, so we can build an environment where we all feel comfortable trusted and open "to sharing our feelings.
" Feelings.
Feelings.
Jesus.
The truth is, for so long, I'd forgotten what those even were.
I've been stuck in one place, in a cave, you might say.
A deep, dark cave.
And then, I left some Eggos out in the woods, and you came into my life and for the first time in a long time, I started to feel things again.
I started to feel happy.
But, lately, I guess I've been feeling distant from you.
Like you're you're pulling away from me or something.
I miss playing board games every night, making triple-decker Eggo extravaganzas at sunrise, watching westerns together before we doze off.
But I know you're getting older.
Growing.
Changing.
And I guess if I'm being really honest, that's what scares me.
I don't want things to change.
So, I think maybe that's why I came in here, to try to maybe stop that change.
To turn back the clock.
To make things go back to how they were.
But I know that's naive.
It's just not how life works.
It's moving.
Always moving, whether you like it or not.
And, yeah, sometimes it's painful.
Sometimes it's sad.
And sometimes it's surprising.
Happy.
So, you know what? Keep on growing up, kid.
Don't let me stop you.
Make mistakes, learn from 'em, and when life hurts you, because it will, remember the hurt.
The hurt is good.
It means you're out of that cave.
But, please, if you don't mind, for the sake of your poor old dad, keep the door open three inches.
I I will be king Are you okay? Yeah.
Time to go? Yeah.
I'll be out in a minute.
Okay.
Oh, we could be heroes Just for one day Oh, we can be us Just for one day I I can remember Standing Standing by the wall And the guns Shot above our heads Oh, we can be heroes Just for one day No.
Not the American.
No, I'm begging you No! Don't! No! Please! No! Don't! No, don't! Don't do this! Let me go! Let me go! Don't leave me in here.
Let me out, I'm innocent.
I'm innocent! I'm begging you, please!
