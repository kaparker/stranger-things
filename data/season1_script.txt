A shadow grows on the wall behind you, swallowing you in darkness.

Turning now to local news, we're getting reports of surges and power outages all across the county.
Last night, hundreds of homes in East Hawkins were affected, leaving many residents in the dark.
The cause of the outage is still unknown.
We reached out to Roane County Water and Electric, and a spokesperson says that they are confident power will be restored to all remaining homes within the next several hours.
Mmm.

I'm just saying, does that seem smart to you? Shut up.
Shut up.

----------
1 Is there a number we can call for your parents? Where's your hair? Do you have cancer? Did you run away? - Are you in some kind of trouble? - Is that blood? - Stop it! You're freaking her out! - She's freaking me out! I bet she's deaf.

Oh, so you can speak.
Okay, well Um, how about we just keep the door just like this.
- Is that better? - Yes.
- This is mental.
- At least she can talk.
She said "no" and "yes.
" Your three-year-old sister says more.
She tried to get naked.
There's something seriously wrong with her.
- Like, wrong in the head.
- She just went like I bet she escaped from Pennhurst.
- From where? - The nuthouse in Kerley County.
- You got a lot of family there? - Bite me.
Seriously though, think about it.
That would explain her shaved hair and why she's so crazy.
Why she went like She's an escapee is the point.
She's probably a psycho.
- Like Michael Myers.
- Exactly! We should've never brought her here.
So you just wanted to leave her out in that storm? Yes! We went out to find Will, not another problem.
- I think we should tell your mom.
- I second that.
- Who's crazy now? - How is that crazy? 'Cause, we weren't supposed to be out tonight, remember? - So? - So if I tell my mom and she tells your mom and your mom - Oh, man.
- Our houses become Alcatraz.
Exactly.
We'll never find Will.
All right, here's the plan.
She sleeps here tonight.
- You're letting a girl - Just listen! In the morning, she sneaks around my house, goes to the front door and rings my doorbell.
My mom will answer and know exactly what to do.
She'll send her back to Pennhurst or wherever she comes from.
We'll be totally in the clear.
And tomorrow night, we go back out.
And this time, we find Will.
Here you go.
This is my sleeping bag.
You really think she's psycho? Wouldn't want her in my house.
Mental.
Hey, um, I never asked your name.
Is that real? Sorry, I've just never seen a kid with a tattoo before.
What's it mean? Eleven? That's your name? Eleven.
Okay.
Um, well, my name's Mike.
Short for Michael.
Maybe we can call you "El.
" Short for Eleven.
Um, well, okay.
'Night, El.
'Night, Mike.
All right, Mom.
Breakfast is ready.
- What? No, be careful of the poster.
- Yeah, okay.

- And? - Nothing.
God.
Flo says you got a phone call? Oh, yeah.
Storm barbecued this pretty good.
- The storm? - What else? You're saying that that's not weird? No, it's weird.
Can we, like, trace who made the call? Contact the No, it doesn't work like that.
Now, uh, you're sure it was Will? Because Flo said you just heard some breathing.
No.
It was him.
It was Will.
And he was scared.
And then something It was probably just a prank call.
It was somebody trying to scare you.
- Who would do that? - Well, this thing's been on TV.
It brings out all the crazies, you know.
False leads, prank calls, uh No, Hopper, it was not a prank.
It was him.
- Joyce.
- Come on, how about a little trust here? What, you think I'm I'm making this up? I'm not saying that you're making it up.
All I'm saying is it's an emotional time for you.
And you think I don't know my own son's breathing? Wouldn't you know your own daughter's? - You hear from, uh, Lonnie yet? - No.
It's been long enough.
I'm having him checked out.
Oh, come on! You're wasting your time.
Hey, Hopper.
Hopper.
Let me go.
- I'm sorry? - To Lonnie's.
You know, if Will's there, it means he ran away.
And if he sees the cops, he'll think he's in trouble.
He'll He'll hide.

Mostly Lucas, 'cause he lives so close.
Signal's pretty weak.
Got you breakfast.
So listen, this is gonna sound a little weird, but I just need you to go out there.
Then go to the front door and ring the doorbell.
My mom will answer and you'll tell her that you're lost and that you need help.
But whatever you do, you can't tell her about last night or that you know me.
Understand? Really, it's no big deal.
We'll just pretend to meet each other again.
And my mom, she'll know who to call.
No.
No? No.
No you don't want my mom to get help? You're in trouble, aren't you? Who Who are you in trouble with? Bad.

When was this? Last night.
Less than two miles away.
- And the boy? - Still missing.
It was my son.

Oh, if Mrs.
Wheeler tells my parents - No way.

We got first every year.
Except for last year when we got third.
Mr.
Clarke said it was totally political.

- Michael? Please? Pop! Papa! Papa! No! Papa! No! No! No! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa.
I just I don't feel good.
I woke up and my head, it really hurt bad, and my throat was all scratchy, and I wanted to tell you, but the last time I told you I was sick - you made me go to school anyway, and - Michael.
- Yeah? - I'm not mad at you.
- No? - No, of course not.
All this that's been going on with Will, I can't imagine what it's been like for you.
I just I want you to feel like you can talk to me.
I never want you to feel like you have to hide anything from me.
I'm here for you.
Okay? Is there someone else here? No.
Eleven? Is everything okay? El? - Mike.
- Is everything okay? Are you sure? Promise.
- Will Byers! - Will! Whoa, whoa.
Careful, careful.
I need you alive for the next few days, at least.
Oh, hell, I could survive that.
What? George Burness made the jump.
And he was drunk as a skunk.
He did it on a $10 bet.
George is a liar.
You make that jump from this height, that water turns into cement.
Hits you like a ton of bricks.
Break every damn bone in your body.
Nah.
Chief, you copy? Yeah, Flo, talk to me.
Hey, Chief, we got a call from over at Benny's.
I think you need to get there right away.
Ugh, Jesus! Suicide? Mmm-hmm.
Missing kid, suicide You must feel like a big city cop again, huh, Chief? Well, I mostly dealt with strangers back then.
Benny was my friend.
Hello? Yeah.
- Can I help you? - Yeah, is Lonnie around? - Yeah, he's out back.
What do you want? - To look around.
- Hey, what do you think you're doing? Hey! - I'll be fast.
Hey, Will? Will! Will, you here? Will! Get off! Damn, you've gotten stronger.
Will someone please explain what the hell is going on? Jonathan, Cynthia.
Cynthia, this is Jonathan.
My oldest.
- Come here.
- Get off me, man.
- Are you out of your mind? - Just listen to me.
- You are out of your mind! - She knows about Will.
What do you mean she knows about Will? She pointed at him, at his picture.
She knew he was missing.
I could tell.
- You could tell? - Just think about it.
Do you really think it was a coincidence that we found her on Mirkwood, the same place where Will disappeared? - That is weird.
- And she said bad people are after her.
I think maybe these bad people are the same ones that took Will.
- I think she knows what happened to him.
- Then why doesn't she tell us? Do you know where he is? Do you know where Will is? - Stop it, you're scaring her! - She should be scared! If you know where he is, tell us! This is nuts.
We have to take her to your mom.
No! Eleven said telling any adult would put us in danger.
- What kind of danger? - Her name is Eleven? - El for short.
- Mike, what kind of danger? Danger danger.
No, no, no! We're going back to plan A.
We're telling your mom.
No.
Take a look at this beaut.
Should've seen it when I got it.
Took me a year, but it's almost done.
Really? You want to check up my ass, too? I told you the same thing as I told those cops, he's not here and he never has been.
- Then why didn't you call Mom back? - I don't know, I just I assumed she just forgot where he was.
You know, he was lost or something.
That boy never was very good at taking care of himself.
This isn't some joke, all right? There are search parties, reporters Hopper's not still chief, is he? Tell your mother she's gotta get you out of that hellhole.
Come out here to the city.
People are more real here, you know? And then I could see you more.
- What, you think I don't want to see you? - I know you don't.
See, that's your mother talkin' right there.
She even know you're here? Oh, great.
So one kid goes missing, the other one runs wild? Some real fine parenting right there.
Look, all I'm saying is, maybe I'm not the asshole, all right? In case you forgot what he looks like.
He's kinda cute, hmm? Maybe I'll trade you in for the younger model? Just doesn't make any sense, Chief.
You, uh, notice anything odd about him the last few weeks? No, we're fixin' to go fishing down the Etowah next Sunday.
I mean, he was lookin' forward to it.
I know that.
He got any enemies you might know about? I mean, people who might not want him around? The exes didn't like him much.
That's for sure, but nah.
- When was the last time you saw him? - Yesterday.
Lunch, same as always.
- Just you and the boys? - Yep.
Me and Henry and Well, there was this, uh, this kid.
No kid did this.
Kid? What are you talking about? Yeah.
At lunch, uh, there was this boy that, uh I mean, he was trying to steal food out of Benny's kitchen.
Can you imagine that? This kid what'd he look like? Well, he was about yea high.
You know, tiny like.
I didn't get a good look at him, though.
He was back in the kitchen.
He look like this? Oh, no, that's That's Lonnie's missin' kid.
No.
This was a different kid.
This one had really short hair.
I mean, it was buzzed nearly down to the scalp.
Yeah, well, let's You know, let's forget about the haircut.
I mean, if this kid had a buzz cut could it be Lonnie's kid? Well, I I didn't get a good look at him.
About the right height, though.
I mean, could've been.
Yeah, that's Could've been.
Because I don't want to go by myself.
Barb Barb, it's not rocket science.
You just tell your parents you're gonna stay at my place afterwards.
No, tell them we're studying.
Nancy! Dinner! Coming! Look, I gotta go.
I'll see you in an hour.
Something wrong with the meatloaf? Oh, no, I had two bologna sandwiches for lunch.
I don't know why.
Me, too.
- It's delicious, Mommy.
- Thank you, sweetie.
So, there's this special assembly thing tonight for Will at the school field.
Barb's driving.
Why am I just hearing about this? I thought you knew.
I told you, I don't want you out after dark until Will is found.
I know, I know, but it'd be super weird if I'm not there.
I mean, everyone's going.
Just be back by 10:00.
Why don't you take the boys, too? - No! - Mmm-mmm.
Don't you think you should be there? For Will? Sorry.
Spasm.
Oh It's okay, Holly.
- It's just a loud noise.
- Nice.
Will! Better come out, buddy.
Will, where are ya? Hey, you think Earl really saw Will? I mean, what's he doin' with a shaved head? And stealing food from Benny? Tell you what, when we find him, we'll ask.
Can't ask a corpse questions.
Hold up! You got something? - Hey, what do you got? - Not sure.
Maybe nothing.
I found this.
In there.
No way a kid crawls through there.
I don't know a scared enough one might.
His brother said he was good at hiding.
El? No adults.
Just us and some meatloaf.
Don't worry.
They won't tell anyone about you.
They promise.
Right? We never would've upset you if we knew you had superpowers.
Ow! What Dustin is trying to say is that they were just scared earlier.
That's all.
We just wanted to find our friend.
"Friend"? Yeah, friend.
Will? What is "friend"? Is she serious? Um, a friend Is someone that you'd do anything for.
You lend them your cool stuff, like comic books and trading cards.
And they never break a promise.
- Especially when there's spit.
- Spit? - A spit swear means - you never break your word.
It's a bond.
That's super important, because friends they tell each other things.
Things that parents don't know.
- Barbara, pull over.
- What? Pull over! What are we doing here? His house is three blocks away.
We can't park in the driveway.
Are you serious? Yeah, the neighbors might see.
This is so stupid.
I'm just gonna drop you off.

No, he doesn't.
Nance seriously.
He invited you to his house.
His parents aren't home.
Come on, you are not this stupid.
Tommy H.

Tommy and Carol have been having sex since, like, seventh grade.
It'll probably just be, like, a big orgy.
- Gross.
- I'm serious! All right, well you can be, like, my guardian.
All right? Make sure I don't get drunk and do anything stupid.
Ugh.
Is that a new bra? No.

Army knife also from 'Nam.
Hammer, camouflage bandana and the wrist rocket.
You're gonna take out the Demogorgon with a slingshot? First of all, it's a wrist rocket.
And second of all, the Demogorgon's not real.
It's made up.
But if there is something out there, I'm gonna shoot it in the eye - and blind it.
- Dustin, what did you get? Well, alrighty.
So, we've got Nutty Bars, Bazooka, Pez, Smarties, Pringles, Nilla Wafers, apple, - banana, and trail mix.

Space weapons? Yeah.
You know, like, Reagan's Star Wars.
I guess we're gonna blow the Ruskies to smithereens.
Hey, can I help you? Uh, yeah.
We're here for a tour.
Oh, we don't give tours.
Okay A quick look around.
You have to get clearance for that.
You can contact, uh Rick Schaeffer at the Department of Energy.
Maybe you seen it on TV.
We got a local kid that's missing.
We have reason to believe he might have snuck in here.
Like I said, you have to speak to Mr.
Schaeffer.
- What's your name? - Patrick.
Patrick, I got a panicked mayor, and I got reporters breathing down my neck and I got a very upset mother.
Now, I know the kid's not in there, but I gotta check off this box.
Patrick, would you do me a favor? Would you speak to your boss and see what you can swing for us? I'd really appreciate it.
I'm talking ten minutes, tops.
was occupying a large part of Lebanon.
Today, Syria has become a home for I have the power! gift that will last forever.
From the Harmony Treasures' collection On the beach and in the sun The real thing is so much fun All the times of your life And the things that you do Coke is right there with you Coke is it! Coke is it! - Joyce - Just ring me up, Donald.
And you think this missing boy may have crawled through there? Well, that was the idea.
Yeah, I just don't see how that'd be possible.
We've got over 100 cameras.
Every square inch covered, plus all my guys.
No one breaks in here.
Certainly not some kid.
Those cameras, you keep the tapes? If you don't mind me asking, what do you guys do in here? You're asking the wrong guy.
- Staying one step ahead of the Russians? - I expect.
Something like that.
- Who's in charge here? - That'd be Dr.
Brenner.
And he builds the space lasers? - Space lasers? - Ignore him.
This is the night of the 6th and 7th we're seeing here? That's correct.
Is that it? Like I said, we would have seen him.
The night of the 7th, we had a search party out for Will.
You remember anything about that night? Mmm, not much to remember.
Called it off.
- 'Cause of the storm.
- Yeah, a lot of rain that night.
You see any rain on that tape? What are you thinking? I don't know.
But they're lying.
That's why science doesn't make any damn sense to me.
No, I swear.
Look at this.
It's totally frostbite.
Oh, thanks, man.
It's a heated pool.
Well, if it's not frostbite, then what is it? Ugh, I don't care what it is, it's disgusting! Get it off the table.
We're eating here.
Ew! Hey, Tommy.
When you left, did you see Barb? - What? - Barbara.
She's not here today.
I seriously have no idea who you're talking about.
Come on, don't be an ass, man.
Did you Did you see her leave last night or not? No, she was gone when we left.
Probably couldn't stand listening to all that moaning.
Oh, Steve! - Oh, Steve! Oh, Steve! - Oh, Steve Oh, Steve! Okay, chill.
Listen I'm sure she's fine.
She's probably just she's probably just, like, skipping or something.
Yeah.
Yeah, probably.
- How about this one? - Too big for the sling.
So, do you think Eleven was born with her powers, like the X-Men, or do you think she acquired them, like like Green Lantern? She's not a superhero.
She's a weirdo.
Why does that matter? The X-Men are weirdos.
If you love her so much, why don't you marry her? What are you talking about? - Mike, seriously? - What? You look at her all, like "Hi, El! El! El! El! I love you so much! - Would you marry me?" - Shut up, Lucas.
Yeah, shut up, Lucas.
What are you losers doing back here? Probably looking for their missing friend.
That's not funny.
It's serious.
He's in danger.
I hate to break it to you, Toothless, but he's not in danger.
He's dead.
That's what my dad says.
He said he was probably killed by some other queer.
Come on.
Just ignore them.
Watch where you're going, Frogface.
- You all right? - Yeah.
Hey.
How about this one? - Yeah.
- Yeah? Yeah, this is it.
Oh, yeah.

Sorry I wasted your time.
I'm a dick.
" Yep.
I'm sorry.
Uh Maybe we could go out again next week? Newspapers? You guys got newspapers around here? We have the New York Times, the Post, all the big ones.

But she did come home, right? After the vigil? No, she said she was staying with you last night.
Right, yes.
She did, sorry.
I meant, did she come home this morning? I think she left some textbooks and she was gonna go pick them up.
Oh, um, no, I haven't seen her.
Do Do you know what? I just remembered she's at the library.
Nancy, will you please have her call me as soon as you find her? Yeah.

Sorry to bother you.

- I was looking for my brother.
- No.
No, this is called stalking.
Mmm-hmm.
- What's going on? - Here's the starring lady.
What? This creep was spying on us last night.
He was probably gonna save this one for later.
See, you can tell that he knows it was wrong, but Man, that's the thing about perverts It's hardwired into 'em.
You know, they just can't help themselves.
So we'll just have to take away his toy.
- Steve - No, please, not the camera.
No, no, wait, wait Tommy, Tommy.
It's okay.

Saturday.
I bet Mr.
Mundy's still a virgin.
Oh, he's so a virgin! Maybe you should blow him, Carol.
Help your grades a bit.
Whoa, Nance, where you going? I totally forgot.
I told my mom I would, um I would do something with her.
Well, what do you mean? The game's about to start.
I'm sorry.
What the hell's wrong with her? Maybe she freaked out when you went all psycho on the psycho.
Oh, give me a break.
What'd you expect, dating Miss Perfect? Why did they hurt you? What? Oh, that.
Uh I just fell at recess.
- Mike - Yeah? Friends tell the truth.
I was tripped by this mouth breather, Troy, okay? Mouth breather? Yeah, you know a dumb person.
A knucklehead.
Knucklehead? I don't know why I just didn't tell you.
Everyone at school knows.
I just didn't want you to think I was such a wastoid, you know? - Mike - Yeah? I understand.
Oh.
Okay, cool.

I need to find you.
Tell me what to do.
Please just Will Hey! You're home early! How was the game? Nancy? What's the matter? It's Barb.
I think something happened.
Something terrible.
I don't know, Chief.
What don't you know? This lady, Terry Ives, sounds like a real nut to me.
Her kid was taken for LSD mind control experiments? She's been discredited.
Claim was thrown out Okay, forget about her.
Take a look at this.
- Dr.
Martin Brenner.
- Who? Brenner.
He runs Hawkins Lab.
Okay.
You don't find that interesting? Not really.
He was involved in some hippie crap back in the day, so what? No, this isn't hippie crap.
This is CIA-sanctioned research.
Doesn't mean he had anything to do with our kid.
Come on.
Look at that.
Hospital gowns.
All of 'em.
Now, that piece of fabric that the teacher found by the pipe.
That sure looked like a hospital gown to me, huh? - Am I wrong? - I don't know, Chief.
Come on, man.
Work with me here.
I'm not saying that there's some grand conspiracy.
I'm just I'm saying maybe something happened.
Maybe Will was in the wrong place at the wrong time and he saw something that he shouldn't have.
- It's a reach.
- It's a start.
Hey, Powell, is the chief with you? Hopper here.
What do you got? Here.
Yeah, this is where Will lives.
Hiding.
No, no, this is where he lives.
He's missing from here.
Understand? - What are we doing here? - She said he's hiding here.
Um no! I swear, if we walked all the way out here for nothing That's exactly what we did.
I told you she didn't know what the hell she was talking about! Why did you bring us here? - Mike, don't waste your time with her.
- What do you want to do then? Call the cops, like we should have done yesterday.
- We are not calling the cops! - Hey, guys? - What other choice do we have? - Guys! Will Okay.
Okay, baby, talk to me.
Talk to me.
Where are you? "R.
" Good, good, good, good.
That's good.
Come on, come on.
"I G H T H E R E" "Right here.

I need you to tell me what to do.
What should I do? How do I get to you? How do I find you? What should I do? Oh, Jesus.
Oh, God.
Please tell me it's not the kid.
It's not Will.
It can't be.
It's Will.
It's really Will.
Mike "Mike"? "Mike," what? You were supposed to help us find him alive.
You said he was alive! Why did you lie to us? What's wrong with you? What is wrong with you? - Mike - What? Mike, come on.
Don't do this, man.
Mike Mike, where are you going? Mike! Mike! Mom? Mom, what happened? It's okay.
Hey.
Michael? What's wrong? Support us and become VIP member 
----------
1 This the wall she was talking about, Chief? A trooper found something in the, uh water that's at the quarry.
Our working theory right now is that Will crashed his bike, he made his way over the quarry and, uh accidentally fell in.
The earth must have given way.
Joyce? Joyce? Do you understand what I'm saying? No.
Whoever you found is not my boy.
- It's not Will.
- Joyce.
No, you don't understand.
I talked to him a half hour ago.
He was He was here.
He was He was talking with these.
- Talking? - Uh-huh.
One blink for yes, two for no.
And And, uh And then I made this so he could talk to me.
'Cause he was hiding from that that thing.
The thing that came out of the wall? - The thing that chased you? - Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Mom, come on, please.
- You've gotta stop this.
- No, maybe he's It's after him! - He's in danger.
We have to find him! We - What exactly was this thing? It was some kind of animal, you said? Uh, no, it was It was almost human, but it wasn't.
It It had these long arms and it didn't have a face.
It didn't have a face? - Joyce.
- It didn't have a face Joyce, listen to me.
Listen to me.
After Sarah I saw her, too.
And I heard her.
I didn't know what was real.
And then I figured out that it was in my mind.
And I had to pack all that away.
Otherwise, I was gonna fall down a hole that I couldn't get out of.
No, you're you're talking about grief.
This is different.
- I'm just saying that you - No, I know what you're saying, Hop.
I swear to you, I know what I saw.
And I'm not crazy.
I'm not saying that you're crazy.
No You are.
And I understand, but God, I I need you to believe me.
Please.
Please.
Listen I think you should go to the morgue tomorrow and see him for yourself.
It'll give you the answers that you need.
- But tonight - Oh, God.
I want you to try to get some sleep, if you can.
Byers' body was found in the water of this quarry by state police earlier this evening.
It was discovered by state trooper David O'Bannon, just after dark.
The state police are mounting an investigation to determine Byers' cause of death, but an initial inquiry Should I go down and talk to Michael? Give him time.
He'll come to us when he's ready.
Can you please stop that? Are you deaf? I thought we were friends, you know? But friends tell each other the truth.
And they definitely don't lie to each other.
You made me think Will was okay, that he was still out there, but he wasn't.
He wasn't! Maybe you thought you were helping, but you weren't.
You hurt me.
Do you understand? What you did sucks.
Lucas was right about you.
All along.
So come on and let me know Should I stay or should I go? Should I stay or should I go now? Should I stay or should I go now? If I go there will be trouble If I stay it will be double Will, is that you? It's Mike! Do you copy? Over.

What what time is it? It's almost 8:00.
We have to go.
Go where? Where? To see Will.
Michael? Hi, honey.
How are you feeling? I, uh I don't think I can go to school today.
Oh, that's fine, sweetie.
I need to drop off Nance, then I'm gonna check in on Barb's parents.
Why don't you grab a book or something and come with me? We can stop by the video store on the way back, pick out whatever you want.
Even R-rated.
I think I just want to stay home today.
I mean, if that's okay? Well, are you sure you're gonna be all right here by yourself? I think so.
Okay.
But if you need anything, call Dad at work.
- Okay.
- Okay.

No, not his funeral.
- Screw his funeral! - What? Just get over here stat.
And bring Dustin.
Over and out.
What's taking so long? Well, everything's been a bit chaotic around here without Gary.
Without Gary? - Where's Gary? - Well, I thought you knew.
Those men from State, they they sent Gary home last night.
So who did the autopsy? Someone from State.
He has a birth mark on his right arm.
Can you show that to me, please? How's your mom doing? I don't know.
How long's this stuff been going on? With the lights and, uh Will and the thing in the wall? Since the first phone call, I guess.
You know, she's had anxiety problems in the past.
But this I don't know.
I'm worried it could be Ugh, I don't know.
She'll be okay.
We'll be okay.
My mom she's tough.
Yeah, she is.
Hey.
She is.
Ma'am! - Ma'am, I need you to sign! - I don't I don't know what you think that thing is in there, but that is not my son! - Joyce, wait a second.
- No! - Mom! - Ma'am, I Ma'am! So, wait a sec.
I don't understand.
You went back to my house? To look for Barb.
Yeah, okay, but why didn't you just talk to me? That's crazy.
I don't know, I I was scared.
You seriously think you saw a guy in a mask just hanging out in my yard? I don't think it was a mask.
But he had no face? I don't know! I don't know, I just I have a terrible feeling about this.
Oh, this is bad.
This is really bad.
What? The cops they're gonna want to talk to all of us now.
Tommy, Carol, everybody who was at the party.
- So? - My parents are gonna murder me! Are you serious right now? You don't understand.
My dad's a grade-A asshole.
Barb is missing! And you're worried about your dad? Okay, just When you talk to the cops, just don't mention the beers.
It's just gonna get us both in trouble, and Barbara's got nothing to do with it, okay? I can't believe you right now.
- I can't believe you.
- Nancy.
Nancy, wait! Nancy! - Mom, will you get in? - No, I I need to think.
Just go on home.
Mom, will you just get in, please? Mom.
Mom! Mom.
- Stop.
- Just go home, Jonathan.
No, this is not an okay time for you to shut down.
- Shut down? What - We have to deal with this, Mom.
We have to deal with the funeral! The funeral? - For for who? - For that thing back there? Okay, let me get this straight.
Will, that's not his body, because he's in the lights, right? And there's a monster in the wall? Do you even hear yourself? I know it sounds crazy.
I sound crazy! - Yeah.
- You think I don't know that? It is crazy! But I heard him, Jonathan.
He talked to me! Will is is calling to me! And he's out there, and he's alone, and he's scared, and I I don't care if anyone believes me! I am not gonna stop looking for him until I find him and bring him home.
I am going to bring him home! Yeah, well, while you're talking to the lights, the rest of us are having a funeral for Will! I'm not letting him sit in that freezer another day! All right, show's over.
What? We keep losing the signal, but you heard it, right? Yeah, I heard a baby.
What? Mike, you obviously tapped into a baby monitor.
It's probably the Blackburns' next door.
Uh, did that sound like a baby to you? - That was Will! - Mike Lucas, you don't understand.
He spoke last night.
Words! He was singing that weird song he loves.
Even El heard him! Oh, well, if the weirdo heard him, then I guess Are you sure you're on the right channel? I don't think it's about that.
I think, somehow, she's channeling him.
- Like like Professor X.
- Yeah.
Are you actually believing this crap? I don't know, I mean Do you remember when Will fell off his bike and broke his finger? He sounded a lot like that.
Did you guys not see what I saw? They pulled Will's body out of the water.
He's dead! Well, maybe it's his ghost.
Maybe he's haunting us.
- It's not his ghost.
- So how do you know that? - I just do! - Then what was in that water? I don't know! All I know is Will is alive.
Will is alive! He's out there somewhere.
All we have to do is find him.
This isn't gonna work.
We need to get El to a stronger radio.
- Mr.
Clarke's Heathkit ham shack.
- Yeah.
The Heathkit's at school.
There is no way we're gonna get the weirdo in there without anyone noticing.
I mean look at her.
Wow.
- She looks - Pretty.
Good.
You look pretty good.
Pretty.
Good.
Clear.
- You boys hear me all right in there? - Loud and clear, Shepard.
Good luck in there, son.
"The brown current ran swiftly out of the heart of darkness, bearing us down towards the sea with twice the speed of our upward progress.
And Kurtz's life was running swiftly, too" Nancy Wheeler? If you'll come with me, please? This argument you and Barbara had? What exactly was it about? It wasn't really an argument.
Barb just wanted to leave.
I didn't, so, I I told her to just go home.
Then what? Then I went upstairs to put on some dry clothes.
And the next day, you went back and saw a bear, you're thinking? I don't know what it was, but I think I think maybe it took Barb.
- You need to check behind Steve's house - We did.
There's nothing there.
- There's no sign of a bear.
- And no car.
- What? - Look.
We figure that Barbara came back last night and then she took off, went somewhere else.
Has she ever talked to you about running off? Leaving town, maybe? No.
No, Barb wouldn't do that, ever.
She wasn't maybe upset about the fact that you were spending time with this boy? Uh, Steve Harrington? What? No! Maybe she was jealous because she saw you go up to Steve's room? It wasn't like that.
Like what? Steve and me, we're we're just friends.
We we just talked.
Now was this before or after you changed out of your clothes? So, Gary, tell me about these troopers that brought in Will.
It was about six of 'em, I'd say.
They're all Staties? Yes, sir.
Never seen that many troopers come with a body before.
They told you that they were gonna take care of the autopsy, huh? Yeah.
Claimed jurisdiction.
Kicked me out.
Well, it all seemed a bit over the top to me, considering Considering what? Considering this was Will Byers and not John F.
Kennedy.
- Thanks for stopping by, Gary.
- Sure thing.
let the people know that, uh, the troopers are on duty and you should be safe, because we think this is just an isolated incident.
State trooper David O'Bannon, thank you so much for your help.
- Thank you, sir.
- Back to you Okay, remember, if anyone sees us, look sad.
Attention students, there will be an assembly to honor Will Byers in the gymnasium now.
Do not go to fourth period.
It's locked.
- What? - Hey, do you think you can open it? With your powers? Boys? Hey.
Assembly's about to start.
We know.
We're just, you know Upset.
Yeah, definitely upset.
We need some alone time.
- To cry.
- Yeah, listen I get it.
I do.
I know how hard this is, but let's just be there for Will, huh? And then the Heathkit is all yours for the rest of the day.
What do you say? I don't believe we've met.
What's your name? - Eleven - Eleanor! She's my, uh - Cousin.
- Second cousin.
She's here for Will's funeral.
Ah, well, welcome to Hawkins Middle, Eleanor.
I wish you were here under better circumstances.
Thank you.
Uh, where are you from exactly? Bad place - Sweden! - I have a lot of Swedish family.
- She hates it there.
- Cold! Subzero.
- Shall we? - Yep! At times like these it is important that we come together as a community.
We come Abort.
We come together to heal we come together to grieve - You lied to the police! - I didn't lie! How naive do you think I am? You and Steve were just talking? We slept together! Is that what you want to know? It doesn't matter! - It does matter! - No! It is all bullshit! It has nothing to do with Barb and she's missing.
And something terrible happened to her.
I know it.
I know it! And no one is listening to me! Sweetie, sweetie, I'm listening.
- I'm listening to you - No! You're not! Nancy Nancy! Just leave me alone! Try him again.
Shepard, come in.
Confirm comm.
Shepard, come in.

Shepard, come in! Over.
Will Byers' death is an unimaginable tragedy.
Will was an exceptional student and a wonderful friend to all of us.
It's impossible to express the hole his loss will leave in our community.
I'd like to introduce you to Sandy Sloane.
She's a local grief counselor from the church over in Jonesboro.
But before she comes up here, I just want those of you who are having trouble dealing with this tragic loss Look at these fakers.
They probably didn't even know his name till today.
What? Who is interested in this? This is so stupid.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah Oh, he was such a great student.
Oh, he's going to leave a hole in the community.
Mouth breather.
Hey! Hey! Hey, Troy! Hey, Troy! You you think this is funny? What'd you say, Wheeler? I saw you guys laughing over there.
And I think that's a real messed up thing to do.
Didn't you listen to the counselor, Wheeler? Grief shows itself in funny ways.
Besides, what's there to be sad about, anyway? Will's in fairyland now, right? Flying around with all the other little fairies.
All happy and gay! You're dead, Wheeler! Dead! Dude, Troy peed himself.
Holy shit! Hey! What's going on here? Oh.
Mike! Let's go! It's made of soft wood with a crepe interior.
Uh, now, I I don't know what your budget is, but over here, we we have copper and bronze.
Can you just give me a second? Of course.
Hey.
Hey.
Your mom, um she said you'd be here.
I just Can we talk for a second? It looks like it could be some kind of perspective distortion, but I wasn't using the wide angle.
I don't know.
It's weird.
And you're sure you didn't see anyone else out there? No.
And she was there one second and then, um gone.
I figured she bolted.
The cops think that she ran away.
But they don't know Barb.
And I went back to Steve's and I thought I saw something.
Some weird man or I don't know what it was.
I'm sorry.
I I shouldn't have come here today.
I'm I'm so sorry.
What'd he look like? What? This man you saw in the woods.
What'd he look like? I don't know.
It was almost like he he didn't have Didn't have a face? How did you know that? Aw, come on! Another, please.
And another for my, uh, friend here.
Oh, thanks, man.
Appreciate it.
Yeah, that's all right.
I'm, uh I'm celebrating.
My daughter, she won the spelling bee today.
Is that right? Yeah, that's right.
"Odontalgia.
" That was the word.
You know what it means? It's a fancy name for a toothache.
Yeah, she's smart.
She's real smart.
Don't know where she gets it from.
I've been tryin' to figure that out for years.
Your daughter, she got a name? What? Your daughter? What's her name? Sarah.
Her name's Sarah.
To Sarah.
I recognize you.
Are you famous or somethin'? Uh, you might have seen me on TV, I, uh I found that Byers boy.
So, you on that case or what? I just saw him on patrol, you know? Dumb luck.
So that quarry, that's, uh that's state-run, where they found the boy, huh? Yeah.
Yeah, well, that's funny.
'Cause, you know, I know for a fact that it's run by the Sattler Company.
Frank Sattler? Decent guy, still got a couple operational quarries up in Roane.
- Is that right? - Yeah.
That's right.
So why are you lying to me, man? What's your problem, bud? I don't have a problem.
I'm just a concerned citizen.
Yeah? Well, stick your nose someplace else.
The kid is dead.
End of story.
Thanks for ruining the game, dick.
Okay Let's try this one more time.
Who told you to be out there? What were you doing out there? I don't know! I don't know.
They they just told me to call it in and not let anybody get too close.
Get close to what? The body.
Who do you work for? The NSA? Hawkins Lab? Who is that? - You're gonna get us both killed.
- Who is that? Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! Talk to me! I know you're here! Come on.
- Now what? - She'll find him.
Right, El? Eleven? Are you listening? That man before you I need you to find him.
- Hurt him? - No.
No, I don't want you to hurt him.
I want you to listen to him.
- Listen? - Yes.
I want you to listen to what he says and repeat his words back to me.
Just like we used to with those old nursery rhymes.
Do you remember? Hmm? Do you think you can do that for me? - Mmm-hmm.
- Good.
Begin.
Amulet.
Frigid.
Evolve.
Airplane.
Eleven? Repeat the words.
Apricot.
Peninsula.
Game.
Enchantment.
Mouse.
Balloon.
She's doing it.
- She's finding him! - This is crazy.
Calm down.
She just closed her eyes.
Holy What is that? Mom? Will? Mom? No way! - Mom - Will! Please Will! Will! Will Will! - Mom! - Will! I'm here! I'm here! - Oh, God - Mom! - Will! - Will, it's us! Are you there? Can you hear us? We're here! Hello? Mom? Why can't he hear us? I don't know! Baby - Mom? - Oh, God.
Will! Mom! Oh, thank God.
Baby Will Mom Mom, it's coming! Tell me where you are! How do I get to you? It's like home, but it's so dark It's so dark and empty.
And it's cold! Mom? Mom! Listen to me! I swear I'm gonna get to you, okay? But right now, I need you to hide.
Mom, please! No, no, listen! Listen, I I will find you, but you have to run now! Run! Run! - El, are you okay? - Oh! Can you move? Here, help her up.
This way! And you're Brightening.
Enlarging.
Hmm.
Did your mom say anything else? Like, um, where it might have gone to, or No, just that it came out of the wall.
How long does this take? Not long.
Have you been doing this a while? What? Photography? Yeah.
I guess I'd rather observe people than, you know Talk to them.
I know.
It's weird.
No! No, it is.
It's just, sometimes people don't really say what they're really thinking.
But you capture the right moment it says more.
What was I saying? What? When you took my picture.
I shouldn't have taken that.
I'm, uh I'm sorry.
It's just That's it.
That's what I saw.
My mom I thought she was crazy 'cause she said that's not Will's body.
That he's alive.
- And if he's alive - Then Barbara.
- Hey, Patty! - Hey, uh, need something, Chief? - Oh, you know, I forgot my hat.
- Oh.
I'll just be a minute.
Hey, I love that book.
It's a nasty mutt.
Hey, you can't be back here.
Yeah, I just got off the line with O'Bannon.
He said that he needs to see you at the station.
- It's some emergency - What the hell are you talking about? I don't work with O'Bannon.
Did I say O'Bannon? I meant Okay.
Babe Jesus, the hell happened? Lonnie.
----------
1 [door beeps] [woman] Thanks.
[indistinct chatter] [breathing heavily] [indistinct chatter] [sighs] [doorknob rattling] - No.
- [bangs door] [sighs] - [gun cocking] - Hands up.
Hands up! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Forgot all the cameras, bub? Look, Dr.
Brenner asked for me specifically.
Okay? How else do you think I got in here? [Hopper scoffs] What's your name again? It's Jim Hopper.
Chief Jim Hopper.
Yeah, I've got Jim Hopper [grunts] - [man on radio] Come again? - [grunts] [both panting] [indistinct radio chatter] Hey you mind if I borrow this one? - [beeps] - [door buzzing] [door locks] - [liquid pouring] - [Lonnie] Drink.
It'll calm your nerves.
Help you think straight, yeah? I don't know what to do.
I know.
I know.
[sniffs] This whole time I I could I could feel him.
He was He was so close.
He was he was right there.
- I knew he was alive.
- [thunder rumbles] Our hands our hands were almost touching.
Now it's like I uh [sobbing] God, it's like I can't feel him anymore.
- Don't look at me like that.
- Like what? Like how everybody is looking at me.
- Like I'm out of my damn mind.
- Hey.
You're not gonna like this, but I think you need to seriously consider the possibility that all this It's in your head.
[scoffs] - You remember your Aunt Darlene? - No.
No, this is not that.
I mean, when something like this happens, your mind makes up stuff for you to cope, you know? I mean, Jesus, there's a funeral tomorrow for our little boy and you're saying his body is fake.
He's in the wall.
I mean, how do you explain that? - [stammers] - It just doesn't make sense.
It doesn't.
- At least go talk to a shrink or - [sighs] - What about Pastor Charles or someone - I don't Well, they can't help.
Joyce, you just told me that Will is gone.
- What else is there to do? - [sniffles] Hey.
[sniffles] [Hopper] Will? Will? Will? Will? [Mike] What was Will saying? Like home Like home but dark? [Lucas] And empty.
[sighs] Empty and cold.
Wait, did he say cold? I don't know.
The stupid radio kept going in and out.
[sighs] It's like riddles in the dark.
Like home.
Like his house? Or maybe like Hawkins.
Upside down.
- What'd she say? - Upside down.
- [Lucas] What? - Upside down.
When El showed us where Will was, she flipped the board over, remember? Upside down.
Dark.
Empty.
Do you understand what he's talking about? - No.
- [Mike] Guys, come on, think about it.
When El took us to find Will, she took us to his house, right? Yeah.
And he wasn't there.
But what if he was there? What if we just couldn't see him? What if he was on the other side? What if this is Hawkins and this is where Will is? The Upside Down.
Like the Vale of Shadows.
[Hopper] Will? - Will? - [alarm blaring faintly] Will? [alarm continues] - [pressing button] - [indistinct chatter] [guards yelling] I see him! Hey! Stop! [Dustin] "The Vale of Shadows is a dimension that is a dark reflection or echo of our world.
It is a place of decay and death.
" [Hopper] Will? "A plane out of phase.
A place of monsters.
It is right next to you, and you don't even see it.
" - [electricity crackling] - [Hopper coughing] Will? Will? An alternate dimension.
But how how do we get there? You cast Shadow Walk.
In real life, dummy.
We can't shadow walk, but maybe she can.
Do you know how we get there? To the Upside Down? [sighing] Oh, my God! [coughing] [exclaims softly] What the hell? [rhythmic pulsing] [gasps] [Hopper] Hey! Hey! Hey! [theme music playing] Hey, kid.
What's going on? Your dad's, uh, gonna stay here tonight.
[stammers] On the couch.
[Lonnie] Yeah, I'm here as long as you need me, okay? How are you holding up? What happened? - Don't worry about that.
- Mom that thing you saw before, did it come back? Jonathan, that's enough.
[sighs] Can we talk? Alone? - You need to leave.
- Look, I know you're upset.
We all are.
But you need to listen to me.
Your mother is sick.
Really sick.
Yeah.
Well, you being here, you're just making things worse, like always.
- Worse? - Yeah! She took down that wall with an ax.
She said that Will was inside and that he's talking to her.
Yeah.
Maybe he was.
This isn't some kind of joke.
Your mom was half frozen to death when I got here.
Trembling, scared out of her mind.
You come in here and you start feeding into her hallucinations or whatever the hell you want to call it, you're gonna push her right over the edge.
You hear me? [sighs] Look, I'm on your side.
I'm here to help.
I'm gonna make things better around here for all of us.
[scoffs] Thank God you're here.
Do me a favor.
At the funeral tomorrow, just behave.
If not for me, for your mother.
Take that down.
It's inappropriate.
- Good.
- Ah! Dad, you're you're choking me.
Ah there.
It's supposed to be a little tight.
Looks good.
- [zipper closing] - Here we go.
[sighs] You look nice, sweetie.
Anything else? You can borrow my black heels if you want.
The ones you wore to Cathy's birthday.
I'm fine.
Thanks.
[whimpering] Ugh.
Come on.
Time to go.
[groans softly] - Come on.
- [sighs] [Pastor Charles] "Fear not, for I am with you.
Be not dismayed, for I am your God.
I will strengthen you.
Yes, I will help you.
I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.
" It's times like these that our faith is challenged.
How, if He is truly benevolent could God take from us someone so young, so innocent? It would be easy to turn away from God but we must remember that nothing, not even tragedy, can separate us from His love.
We are here today to find comfort in the truth of scripture, - and to surround Will and his family - [sniffles] Just wait till we tell Will that Jennifer Hayes was crying at his funeral.
[shushes] - [Karen] I'm so, so sorry.
- Oh, thank you so much for coming.
Yeah, if there's anything we can do I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.
Take care, all right? Thanks.
Thanks for coming out.
I see Will the Wise is back.
What's that shooting out of his cane? Fireballs.
I couldn't find the red crayon, so that's why it's green.
Oh, well if he's so wise, why does he need fireballs? Why can't he just, you know, outsmart the bad guys? Most of the time, yeah, totally.
But sometimes the bad guys are smart, too.
You know? Yeah.
So he needs the fireballs? Well, yeah, to burn them to a crisp.
All right.
Well, I don't know who's been raising you, but I'm gonna get you some new crayons because it looks like he's shooting cabbages.
[both chuckle] [gasping] [breathing heavily] [panting] [dishes clattering] [exclaims] [Lucas] Will! Will, it's us! Are you there? [Dustin] Can you hear us? We're here! [Will distorted] Hello? Mom? - [Lucas] Why can't he hear us? - [Mike] I don't know! [Will distorted] Mom, it's coming! She was there.
[church bell tolling] This is where we know for sure it's been, right? - So, that's - Steve's house.
And that's the woods where they found Will's bike and that's my house.
- It's all so close.
- Yeah.
Exactly.
I mean, it's all within a mile or something.
Whatever this thing is, it's it's not traveling far.
You want to go out there.
We might not find anything.
I found something.
And if we do see it then what? [sighs] We kill it.
- What are you doing? - Just give me a second.
Are you serious? What? You want to find this thing and take another photo? Yell at it? This is a terrible idea.
Yeah, well, it's the best we've got.
What? You can tell someone, but they're not gonna believe you.
You know that.
Your mom would.
- She's been through enough.
- She deserves to know.
Yeah, and I'll tell her when this thing is dead.
I don't know what in the world caused it.
- Let's take a look, huh? - Yeah.
Mr.
Clarke says he's never seen anything like it.
Mr.
Clarke? Yeah, he runs the AV Club.
[repairman] That right? Apparently, some of the less athletic types go nuts for this stuff.
[engine starting] [indistinct chatter] [Mike] Mr.
Clarke? Oh, hey, there.
How are you boys holding up? [munching] We're in mourning.
Man, these aren't real Nilla Wafers.
[Mike] We were wondering if you had time to talk? - We have some questions.
- A lot of questions.
So, you know how in Cosmos, Carl Sagan talks about other dimensions? Like, beyond our world? Yeah, sure.
Theoretically.
Right, theoretically.
So, theoretically, how do we travel there? You guys have been thinking about Hugh Everett's Many-Worlds Interpretation, haven't you? Well, basically, there are parallel universes.
Just like our world, but just infinite variations of it.
Which means there's a world out there where none of this tragic stuff ever happened.
Yeah, that's not what we're talking about.
- Oh.
- We were thinking of more of an evil dimension, like the Vale of Shadows.
You know the Vale of Shadows? An echo of the Material Plane, where necrotic and shadow magic [Mike] Yeah, exactly.
If that did exist, a place like the Vale of Shadows, how would we travel there? - Theoretically.
- [Mr.
Clarke] Well Picture an acrobat standing on a tightrope.
Now, the tightrope is our dimension.
And our dimension has rules.
You can move forwards, or backwards.
But, what if right next to our acrobat, there is a flea? Now, the flea can also travel back and forth, just like the acrobat.
- Right? - Right.
Here's where things get really interesting.
The flea can also travel this way along the side of the rope.
He can even go underneath the rope.
- [boys] Upside down.
- Exactly.
But we're not the flea, we're the acrobat.
In this metaphor, yes, we're the acrobat.
So we can't go upside down? No.
Well, is there any way for the acrobat to get to the Upside Down? Well you'd have to create a massive amount of energy.
More than humans are currently capable of creating, mind you, to open up some kind of tear in time and space, and then you create a doorway.
- Like a gate? - Sure.
Like a gate.
- But again, this is all - Theoretical.
But but what if this gate already existed? Well, if it did, I I think we'd know.
It would disrupt gravity, the magnetic field, our environment.
Heck, it might even swallow us up whole.
Science is neat.
But I'm afraid it's not very forgiving.
Whoa.
Hey, Chief! - [knocking] Hello? Whoa! - Hey! - [Powell] Jesus, Chief.
You all right? - What are you doing here? - We tried calling, but - Yeah, the phone's dead.
Hey, so Bev Mooney came in this morning all upset.
Said that Dale and Henry went hunting yesterday and they didn't come back home.
She thought they were on another binger, but she's not so sure now.
I think this whole Will Byers thing has everybody on edge.
- Where was this? - It was at the station.
No, no.
Where did Henry and Dale go hunting? Oh.
Uh, out near Kerley.
Mirkwood.
What? Okay.
You go back to the station.
I'll take care of this, all right? - Are you sure? - Yeah, leave it.
- Oh, hey.
Uh, they found Barbara's car.
- What? Barbara Holland's car.
Seems she ran away after all.
Staties found it late last night at a bus station.
Funny, right? They keep doing our job for us.
Yeah.
[chuckles] It's funny.
[door closes] - Is he off his meds again? - [engine starts] He's been spending too much time with Joyce Byers.
That's what I think.
[sighs] What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? You want to freeze to death all winter? [hammering continues] - I told you not to take these down.
- They were in the way, babe.
How long are you gonna keep those up? I mean, really? You know, it's a shame what they've done to this family.
- What? - The Sattler Company.
I went to the quarry on the way over here.
I just wanted to look around, you know? Couldn't believe it.
I just couldn't believe it.
No warning signs, no fence, no nothing.
Ought to be held accountable if you ask me.
It would take a lot of energy to build a gate like this.
But that's got to be what happened.
- Otherwise, how'd Will get there, right? - Right.
What we want to know is, do you know where the gate is? Then how do you know about the Upside Down? [Mike] Dustin, what are you doing? Dustin? - Dustin! - Dustin! - I I need to see your compasses.
- What? Your compasses.
All of your compasses, right now! What's exciting about this? - Well, they're all facing north, right? - Yeah, so? - Well, that's not true north.
- What do you mean? I mean exactly what I just said.
That's not true north.
Are you both seriously this dense? The sun rises in the east, and it sets in the west.
Right? Which means that's true north.
So what you're saying is the compasses are broken.
[sighs] Do you even understand how a compass works? - Do you see a battery pack on this? - No.
No, you don't.
Because it doesn't need one.
The needle's naturally drawn to the Earth's magnetic North Pole.
So what's wrong with them? Well, that's what I couldn't figure out, but then I remembered.
You can change the direction of a compass with a magnet.
If there's the presence of a more powerful magnetic field, the needle deflects to that power.
And then I remembered what Mr.
Clarke said.
The gate would have so much power It could disrupt the electromagnetic field.
Exactly.
Meaning, if we follow the compasses' north They should lead us to the gate.
[sighs] Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa.
- [exhales] What are you doing here? - What are you doing? - Nothing.
- I hope that's not meant for me.
What? No.
Oh, no, I was just - thinking about joining softball.
- Oh.
Well, uh listen, I'm really sorry.
I mean, even before you threatened me with the baseball bat.
Okay.
I panicked and [sighs] - I mean, I was a total dick.
- Yeah, you were.
[sighs] Did you get in trouble with your parents? Totally, but you know, who cares? Screw 'em.
Any news about Barbara? - Parents heard from her? Or - No.
Hey, listen.
Why don't we, uh, why don't we catch a movie tonight, you know? Just kinda pretend everything's normal for a few hours.
All The Right Moves is still playing.
You know, with your lover boy from Risky Business? [chuckles] Yeah, I know.
You know, Carol thinks I actually kinda look like him.
What do you think? Huh? Just take those old records Off the shelf I'll sit and listen to them by myself I just, I I don't think I can.
I've been really busy with this whole funeral thing and [inhales] with my brother.
It's been really hard on him.
Yeah, sure.
Sure, yeah, yeah.
So I should go.
Sorry.
I'll call you later.
Is that okay? Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
Just take those old records Off the shelf I'll sit and listen to them [sighs] [Joyce] You were here for the money! [Lonnie] No! The money! Admit it! You aren't here 'cause of Will.
You never cared about him.
You never did! Jesus, Joyce, it was his funeral today.
Do we have to do this right now? - I can't believe I fell for this.
- I'm here to help, Joyce.
- To help? - We could use that money for good.
[stammering] Oh, like maybe to pay off your debts? To pay for Jonathan to go to school! - Oh, don't do that.
- Do what? - Lie to me! - I'm not lying to you! Yeah, well, where does he wanna go? - Huh? - What? Where does Jonathan want to go to college? We get that money, anywhere he damn well pleases! NYU, Lonnie! He's wanted to go to NYU since he was six years old! So then he goes to NYU! Get out.
Get out! You need me here, Joyce.
[laughs] Oh, brother, I have not needed you for a long time! Oh, no? Look what happened.
[scoffs] Oh, don't you dare.
- At least I was here! - Oh, come on, Joyce.
Just look around at this place.
All your Christmas lights.
What the hell am I supposed to think? You're such a great mom? You're a mess! Maybe I am a mess.
Maybe I'm crazy.
Maybe I'm out of my mind! But, God help me, I will keep these lights up until the day I die if I think there's a chance that Will's still out there! Now, get out! Get out of my house! [sighs] [Nancy] You're supposed to hit the cans, right? No, actually, you see the spaces in between the cans? I'm aiming for those.
Ah.
You ever shot a gun before? - [scoffs] Have you met my parents? - [chuckles softly] Yeah, I haven't shot one since I was ten.
My dad took me hunting on my birthday.
He made me kill a rabbit.
- A rabbit? - Yeah.
I guess he thought it would make me into more of a man or something.
I cried for a week.
Jesus.
What? I'm a fan of Thumper.
[chuckles] I meant your dad.
Yeah.
I guess he and my mother loved each other at some point, but [gun cocks] I wasn't around for that part.
Um, yeah.
Just, uh, point and shoot.
I don't think my parents ever loved each other.
They must've married for some reason.
My mom was young.
My dad was older, but he had a cushy job, money, came from a good family.
So they bought a nice house at the end of the cul-de-sac and started their nuclear family.
Screw that.
Yeah.
Screw that.
- [beer can clatters] - [both chuckle] [dialing] [line ringing] - [woman] Hello? - Hey.
Jim? - Yeah.
- [sighs] Why are you calling me here? I told you not to call me.
I know, I know, I know.
I just wanted to I just wanted to hear your voice and, uh I just wanted to say that, um even after everything that happened, I don't I don't regret any of it.
And those seven years, they were everything to me.
Have you been drinking? No.
- No.
- [baby crying over phone] [woman shushing] Honey, hey Hey, it's okay it's okay.
[shushing] [crying continues] You know what, actually, I have been drinking, I'm sorry.
Jim, I can't Just take care of yourself, okay? Say hi to Bill for me.
Are you sure [phone ringing] [ringing stops] [sighs] How much further? I don't know.
These only tell direction, not distance.
You really need to learn more about compasses.
I'm just saying.
How do we know when we get to the gate? Uh, I think a portal to another dimension is gonna be pretty obvious.
[sighs] Do you think she's acting weird? You're asking if the weirdo is acting weird? I mean, weirder than normal? I don't know.
Who cares? [breathing heavily] How far, Papa? Farther than we've ever gone before.
- The bath? - Yes.
Yes, the bath.
Is that okay? Okay.
Mike.
Yeah? Turn back.
What? Why? I'm tired.
[sighs] Look, I'm sure we're almost there.
Just hold on a little longer, okay? [sighs] [Nancy] You never said what I was saying.
[Jonathan] What? [Nancy] Yesterday.
You said I was saying something and that's why you took my picture.
Oh, uh I don't know.
My guess I saw this girl, you know, trying to be someone else.
But for that moment it was like you were alone, or you thought you were.
And, you know, you could just be yourself.
That is such bullshit.
[stammers] What? I am not trying to be someone else.
Just because I'm dating Steve and you don't like him You know what? Forget it.
I just thought it was a good picture.
He's actually a good guy.
[stammers] Okay.
Yesterday, with the camera He's not like that at all.
He was just being protective.
Yeah, that's one word for it.
Oh, and I guess what you did was okay? No, I I never said that.
He had every right to be pissed Okay, all right.
Does that mean I have to like him? No.
Listen, don't take it so personally, okay? I don't like most people.
He's in the vast majority.
You know, I was actually starting to think that you were okay.
- Yeah? - Yeah.
Yeah, I was thinking, "Jonathan Byers, maybe he's not the pretentious creep everyone says he is.
" Well, I was just starting to think you were okay.
- Oh.
- I was thinking, "Nancy Wheeler, she's not just another suburban girl who thinks she's rebelling by doing exactly what every other suburban girl does until that phase passes and they marry some boring one-time jock who now works sales, and they live out a perfectly boring little life at the end of a cul-de-sac.
Exactly like their parents, who they thought were so depressing, but now, hey, they get it.
" [scoffs] [scoffs] [pounding on door] Go away, Lonnie.
[continues pounding] Seriously! I am gonna murd [whispers] What? What? [Hopper sighs] Oh, Jesus.
[scoffs] Oh, no.
"Oh, no"? What's, "Oh, no"? - We're headed back home.
- What? - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure.
Setting sun, right there.
We looped right back around.
And you're just realizing this now? - Why is this all on me? - Because you're the compass genius! What do yours say? [both] North.
- [Lucas sighs] - Makes no damn sense.
[sighs] Maybe the gate moved.
No, I don't think it's the gate.
I think it's something else screwing with the compasses.
Maybe it's something here.
No, it has to be like a super magnet.
It's not a magnet.
She's been acting weirder than normal.
If she can slam doors with her mind, she can definitely screw up a compass.
Why would she do that? Because she's trying to sabotage our mission.
Because she's a traitor! [Mike] Lucas, what are you doing? You did it, didn't you? You don't want us to reach the gate.
You don't want us to find Will.
[Mike] Lucas, come on, seriously, - just leave her alone! - Admit it.
- No.
- Admit it! - Fresh blood.
I knew it.
- Lucas, come on! I saw her wiping her nose on the tracks! She was using her powers! Bull! That's old blood.
Right, El? Right, El? [crying] It's not it's not safe.
- [Hopper panting] - [light bulbs clattering] [panting] Okay.
Should be okay, I mean I can't guarantee it, but it should be okay.
What the hell is going on, Hopper? They bugged my place.
- What? - They bugged my place.
They put a microphone in the light.
[sighs] It's because I'm on to them and they know it.
- I don't know - Who? I thought they might be watching you, too.
I don't know, the CIA, the NSA, Department of Energy I don't know.
You gotta explain this to me, 'cause I am not I went to the morgue last night, Joyce.
What? It wasn't him.
What? Will's body, it was a fake.
[Joyce exclaims] You were right.
This whole time, you were right.
What did I tell you? She's been playing us from the beginning! That's not true.
She helped us find Will! Find Will? Find Will? Where is he, then? Huh? I don't see him.
- Yeah, you know what I mean.
- No, I actually don't.
Just think about it, Mike.
She could've just told us where the Upside Down was right away, but she didn't.
She just made us run around like headless chickens.
- All right, calm down! - No! She used us, all of us! She helped just enough so she could get what she wants.
Food and a bed.
- She's like a stray dog.
- Screw you, Lucas! No! Screw you, Mike.
You're blind blind because you like that a girl's not grossed out by you.
But wake up, man! Wake the hell up! She knows where Will is, and now she's just letting him die in the Upside Down.
- Shut up! - For all we know, it's her fault.
Shut up.
We're looking for some stupid monster but did you ever stop to think that maybe she's the monster? I said shut up! [grunting] - Stop! - [Dustin] Knock it off, you idiots.
- Stop it! - [Dustin] Mike, get off! - Stop it! - [grunting] [screams] Jesus! Lucas! Lucas! Lucas, are you all right? - Lucas.

[indistinct whimper] [whimpering continues] - [Nancy] Oh, God.
- [whimpering] [Jonathan sighs] [Nancy] It's been hit by a car.
We can't just leave it.
[whimpering] I'll do it.
- I thought you said - I'm not nine anymore.
[sighs] - [cocks gun] - [breathing heavily] [both gasping] What was that? [both panting] [Nancy] Where'd it go? I don't know.
Do you see any more blood? No.
[liquid dripping] Jonathan? - [snarling] - [gasps] [gnawing] - [twig snaps] - [roars] [screams] [gasps] Nancy! Nancy? Nancy? Nancy, where are you? Nancy! Nancy! [rock music playing]

[theme music playing] [pop song playing on car stereo] I just don't understand why we're coming out here.
She obviously doesn't wanna talk to you.
That's that's not it.
Oh, really? Because no girl would ever blow off King Steve.
She was acting weird.
I mean, something was wrong.
So what? [scoffs] Like, you're worried about her? - What? - Aw, you are.
- Aw, Steve has a heart.
- Would you just Stop.
- Oh, Stevey's in love.
- Would you just shut up? - Who knew? - Shut up! [chuckling] Jeez.
- [Carol] Damn.
Sorry.
- [Tommy chuckles] [sighs] So this is it, huh? Princess' castle.
[Steve] I'll just be a minute.
[Joyce] Look, we gotta go through this again.
- I told you everything that I saw.
- Oh, gosh.
Tell me again.
- Upstairs or downstairs? - Upstairs.
There was a laboratory.
It was where they must do experiments or something, and then there was [inhales deeply] There was this kid's room.
- How do you know it was a kid's room? - More like a prison.
So why would you think it was a kid's room, then? Because, I told you, the size of the bed, there was a drawing, there was a stuffed animal [stammers] You didn't say there was a drawing.
Yeah, there was a drawing of a an adult and a child.
- It said "Eleven" on it.
- Was it good? It was a kid's drawing, Joyce.
It was stick figures.
[sighs] Wasn't Will.
Earl The night that Benny died, Earl said he saw some kid with a shaved head with Benny.
Now, I pressed him, he said it might be Will, but maybe Wait Maybe, it wasn't? Look this woman, Terry Ives, she claims to have lost her daughter, Jane.
She sued Brenner, she sued the government Now, the claims came to nothing, but what if I mean, what if this whole time I've been I've been looking for Will I've been chasing after some other kid? - [Jonathan gasps] - [monster growling] - [growling] - [gasps] [Jonathan] Nancy! [monster growls] Better? Yeah.
Is this okay? Uh, I found it in the closet.
I can go home.
[stammers] I just figured Yeah, no.
I [stammers] - I don't wanna be alone.
- [sighs] - Do you? - No.
Uh no.
[sighs] Can you just come up here? Yeah.
- Do you want the lights off, or - [softly] On.
[softly] Yeah.
You know, it it can't get us in here.
We don't know that.
Uh, yeah, it's Ives.
Terry Ives.
That's with a "Y.
" Yeah, I got a pen.
Hang on.
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Great, thanks.
I really appreciate this, Frank.
Say hi to the boys for me, too, would you? Did you get it? - I got it.
- Okay.
[grunting softly] [pages rustling] Oh Hey.
[Nancy] Hey.
[grunts] Couldn't sleep? Every time I close my eyes, I just keep seeing that thing.
Wherever I was, that place I think that it lives there.
It was feeding there.
Feeding on that deer.
That means that if [inhales deeply] if Will and Barbara Hey.
My mom said she talked to Will.
If he's alive, there's a chance Barbara is, too.
That means that she's trapped in that place.
We have to find it again.
You wanna go back out there? Maybe we don't have to.
When I saw it, it was feeding on that deer.
- Meaning it's it's a predator, right? - Right.
And it seems to hunt at night, like a a lion or a coyote.
But it doesn't hunt in packs like them.
It's always alone, like like a bear.
And remember at Steve's, when Barb cut herself? - And then, last night, the deer - Hmm, it was bleeding, too.
One sec.
Sharks can detect blood in one part per million.
That's one drop of blood in a million, and they can smell it from a quarter mile away.
So you're saying it can detect blood? [softly] It's just a theory.
We could test it.
But if it works At least we'll know it's coming.
- [door knob rattles] - [both gasp] - [Nancy sighs] - [Karen] Honey, are you up? Yeah, I'm I'm getting dressed.
[Karen] I, uh, made some blueberry pancakes.
I'll be down in a second.
- [footsteps receding] - [sighing] [Jonathan sighing] - [sighs] - Your mom doesn't knock? [both chuckle] [knocking on door] - Hi.
Scott Clarke? - Uh, yes.
The same Scott Clarke who teaches science and AV - at Hawkins Middle? - The very same.
Oh, wonderful.
And we're making a newsletter, which we'll send out monthly.
It'll showcase all the latest equipment, as well as how-to articles, which the kids write themselves.
Oh, that's neat.
What we're really trying to do here, Mr.
Clarke Uh, please, call me Scott.
Scott.
What we're trying to do here, Scott, is to connect kids from all over the state and give them the support and encouragement to pursue careers in technology.
We feel these are the kinds of kids that are going to make Indiana proud.
I agree, yes.
Completely.
So, you know any kids you think might wanna participate? Oh, I have a few in mind.
[Mike sighs] I just I can't believe she didn't come back.
- [Dustin] She's gotta be close.
- She said it wasn't safe.
She just messed up the compasses because she wanted to protect us.
- She didn't betray us.
- Mike, calm down.
I shouldn't have yelled at her.
I never should've done that.
- Mike, this isn't your fault.
- Yeah, it's Lucas'.
It wasn't his fault, either.
- It wasn't his fault? - No.
So you're saying he wasn't way out of line? - Totally, but so were you! - What? - And so was Eleven.
- Oh, give me a break! No, Mike, you give me a break! All three of you were being a bunch of little assholes! I was the only reasonable one.
But the bottom line is you pushed first.
And you know the rule.
You draw first blood No! No way! I'm not shaking his hand.
- You're shaking his hand! - No, I'm not.
This isn't a discussion.
This is the rule of law.
Obey or be banished from the party.
Do you wanna be banished? - No.
- Good.
Where are we going? Where do you think? We're going to get Lucas.
And then we're gonna find Eleven.
[door opens] [breathing heavily] Today is a very special day.
Do you know why? Because today, we make history.
Today, we make contact.
[breathing heavily] [birds chirping] [sighing] [breathing heavily] [screams] [birds chirping] [Karen] Here you go.
Ah yum.
Okay.
Now, sweetie, swallow the pancake.
Where is Nancy? I thought she was coming down.
[sighs] She is.
Uh, she was.
I don't know.
- Nancy, what's taking so long? - [music playing faintly] Nancy? - [door knob rattles] - [sighs] Nancy, come on.
- [sighs] - [music continues] Nan [doorbell rings] What do you want? [sighs] I drew first blood, so Okay, I'll shake.
On one condition.
We forget the weirdo and go straight to the gate.
- Then the deal's off.
- Fine! - Fine! - [Dustin] No, no, not fine! Guys, seriously? Do you even remember what happened on the Bloodstone Pass? [sighs] We couldn't agree on what path to take, so we split up the party and those trolls took us out one by one.
And it all went to shit.
And we were all disabled! So we stick together, no matter what! Yeah, I agree.
But this is the party, right here in this room.
- El is one of us now.
- Um, no, she's not.
Not even close! Never will be.
She's a liar, a traitor She was just trying to keep us safe! She didn't mean to hurt you.
It was an accident! An accident? All right, accident or not - admit it, it was a little awesome.
- Awesome? Yeah, she threw you in the air with her mind! I could have been killed! Which is exactly why we need her.
She's a weapon! Do you seriously wanna fight the Demogorgon with your wrist rocket? That's like R2-D2 going to fight Darth Vader.
We're no use to Will if we're dead.
If you two wanna waste your time looking for a traitor, go ahead, 'cause I'm not spending my time on her anymore.
No way! I'm going to the gate.
I'm gonna find Will.
[upbeat music playing on PA] [indistinct chatter] [Dr.
Brenner] It's okay, Eleven.
Don't be frightened.
These are all friends.
They're just here to watch.
Don't focus on them.
Stay in here, like before.
Yes, Papa.
Now, remember.
Whatever it is, it can't hurt you.
Not from here.
So there's nothing to be frightened of.
It's reaching out to you 'cause it wants you.
Hmm? It's calling you so don't turn away from it this time.
I want you to find it.
Understand? Yes.
[man] Are you lost? Is your mom here? Your dad? Mouth breather.
- What should we do? - Uh Call the police.
Excuse me.
Young lady! You know you have to pay for those! - Hey! Stop right - [woman screams] - Please.
- [woman grunts] [stammers] You have to pay for those! Stop right there! Thief! Thief! - [glass shattering] - [clamoring] Can I help you? Hi, we're looking for Terry Ives.
Does she live here? - Who's asking? - The Hawkins chief of police.
And you want to talk to my sister? Well, if your sister's Terry Ives, then, yeah, we do.
Okay, well, you can come in, but if you want Terry to tell you anything, you're about five years too late.
[TV playing indistinctly] Terry, you have some visitors.
Hello.
My name's Joyce Byers.
Uh, this is Hopper.
We drove over from Hawkins.
Um, you see, uh, my son he's been missing for almost a week now, and, um, we were wondering if we could talk to you about your daughter, Jane? If there's anything that you could tell us about when she was taken What was your relationship with Dr.
Brenner? You guys keep in touch? This is, uh this is him.
[stammering] This is Will.
Uh, you may have seen him on on the news.
- Uh - What's wrong with her? I told you, you're wasting your time.
[Dustin] This is weird without Lucas.
- He should've shaken my hand.
- He's just jealous.
What are you talking about? [sighs] Sometimes, your total obliviousness just blows my mind.
He's your best friend, right? - Yeah I mean, I don't know.
- It's fine.
I get it.
I didn't get here until the fourth grade.
He had the advantage of living next door.
But none of that matters.
What matters is that he is your best friend.
And then this girl shows up and starts living in your basement, and all you ever want to do is pay attention to her.
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.
And you know it.
And he knows it.
But no one ever says anything until you both start punching and yelling at each other like goblins with intelligence scores of zero.
- Now everything's weird.
- He's not my best friend.
- [chuckles] Yeah, right.
- [sighs] I mean, he is, but so are you.
- And so is Will.
- Can't have more than one best friend.
- Says who? - Says logic.
Well, I call bull on your logic, because you're my best friend, too.
Okay.
[panting] Whoa.
- [indistinct conversations] - [Dustin] You don't think [panting] Uh definitely.
[audience applauding on TV] [host on TV] Are you ready? [Becky] She was a part of some study in college.
- MK Ultra? - Yeah, that's the one.
[exhales] Was, uh, started in the '50s.
By the time Terry got involved, it was supposed to be ramping down, but the drugs just got crazier.
Messed her up good.
This was the CIA that ran this? You and Terry would've gotten along.
"The Man," with a big capital "M.
" [sighing] They'd pay you know, a couple hundred bucks to people like my sister, give 'em drugs, psychedelics.
LSD, mostly.
And then they'd strip her naked and put her in these isolation tanks.
- Isolation tanks? - [Becky] Yeah.
These big bathtubs, basically, filled with salt water, so you can float around in there.
You lose any sense of, uh sense and feel nothing, see nothing.
They wanted to expand the boundaries of the mind.
Real hippie crap.
I I mean, it's not like they were forcing her to do any of this stuff.
The thing is, though, is that she didn't know she was pregnant at the time.
Jane.
[sighs] Do you have any pictures of her? I don't think you guys understand.
Terry miscarried in the third trimester.
She keeps all of this up.
Been doing it for 12 years.
[sighs] Terry, uh, pretends like Jane is real, - like she's gonna come home someday.
- [lullaby plays from mobile] Says she's special.
Born with "abilities.
" Abilities? [bones cracking] You read any Stephen King? - [hisses] - [beeping] [stammers] [chuckles] You guys look scared, actually.
[chuckles] I mean, it's all make-believe.
[clears throat] What what kind of abilities? Telepathy, telekinesis [Eleven screams] You know, shit you can do with your mind.
That's why the big, bad Man stole Jane away.
[yelling] Papa! Her baby's a weapon, off fighting the commies.
You know, the doctors all say it's a coping mechanism.
You know, to deal with the guilt.
Do you think there is any chance she could be telling the truth? [stammering] About having had the kid.
There is no birth certificate, nothing from the hospital.
Doctors and nurses all confirm that she miscarried.
Yeah, but that could've been covered up.
Right? Like I said, you and Terry would've gotten along.
Oh, man.
[grunts] [clattering] And I'll have four boxes of the .
38s.
What you kids doin' with all this? Um - Monster hunting.
- Huh.
[scoffs] [cash register dings] "Monster hunting"? You know, last week I was shopping for a new top I thought Steve might like.
It took me and Barb all weekend.
It seemed like life or death, you know? And and now You're shopping for bear traps with Jonathan Byers.
Yeah.
What's the weirdest part? Me or the bear trap? You.
It's definitely you.
[chuckles] - [car horn honking] - [Reed] Hey, Nance! Can't wait to see your movie.
[laughs] What the hell was that? I don't know.
What? What? Hey! Where are you going? - [panting] - Nancy, wait! [whimpers] Nancy! - [man 1] I can't believe it.
- [man 2] These kids! - [Jonathan] Jesus.
- [sighs] Wow.
- [spray can hissing] - [Tommy laughing] [Jonathan] Wait! [Carol] Tommy, you write like a three-year-old.
- [Tommy] Shut up! - [Nicole] I didn't know you could spell.
[Tommy speaks indistinctly] [indistinct chatter] [laughter] Aw, hey there, princess! [Tommy] Uh-oh! She looks upset.
[Carol] Oh! [Tommy] Damn! What is wrong with you? What's wrong with me? What's wrong with you? I was worried about you.
I can't believe that I was actually worried about you.
[scoffs] - What are you talking about? - I wouldn't lie if I were you.
You don't want to be known as the lying slut now, do you? Speak of the devil.
Hi.
You came by last night? Ding! Ding! Ding! Does she get a prize? Look, I don't know what you think you saw, but it wasn't like that.
What, you just let him into your room to study? Or for another pervy photo session? [laughs] - We were just - [Steve] You were just what? Finish that sentence.
Finish the sentence.
[breathing heavily] [scoffs] Go to hell, Nancy.
Come on, Nancy, let's just leave.
You know what, Byers? I'm actually kind of impressed.
I always took you for a queer, but I guess you're just a little screw-up like your father.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that house is full of screw-ups.
You know, I guess I shouldn't really be surprised.
A bunch of screw-ups in your family.
- Jonathan, leave it.
- I mean, your mom I'm not even surprised what happened to your brother.
[Nancy] Steve, shut up! I'm sorry I have to be the one to tell you, but the Byers, their family, it's a disgrace to the entire [grunts] - [groans] - [Jonathan breathing heavily] - [grunts] - [Nancy] Steve! - [Tommy] Oh! - [both grunting] - [Nancy] Steve.
- [groans] Stop! Steve! Knock it off, you guys! - [Carol] Get off of him, seriously! - Kick his ass, man! - [Carol] Get off! Stop! - [both continue grunting] Get in there, he's going to hurt himself! Hey.
Hey! Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here! [both grunting] Jonathan, stop! Stop! You're going to hurt him! - Jonathan, stop! - [sirens wailing] [Tommy] Cops! [Nancy] Guys Jonathan, get off of him! - Stop it! - [Tommy] Cops! Come on! - Stop it! Come on! - Cops! - You have to stop! - Just go, Carol! - [Nancy] Stop it! - [both grunting] Hey, he's had enough, man! I said he's had enough! - Kids! All right! - Stop it!

We appreciate it.
[Becky] Hmm, yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.
[door opens] - Good luck.
- [Hopper] Thank you.
[sighing] Hey [softly] What? We're gonna find him.
Yeah, like Terry found her daughter? We're close.
[breath trembling] Twelve years? Twelve years she's been looking for her And then she shows up at Benny's five nights ago, which means we've got a chance.
You know what I would give? For a chance? You know what I would give? [Callahan over radio] Hey, Chief, you there? - Hey, Chief? - Yeah, go ahead.
Yeah, a fight broke out here and - Cal, I don't have time for this.
- It's Jonathan Byers.
You haven't seen Joyce, have you? Do you think we'll be out of here soon? You, yes.
Him, no.
He assaulted a police officer.
- [ice cubes clatter] - Well, how long are you gonna keep him? You and your boyfriend have big plans, do you? [chuckles] He's not my boyfriend.
I think you better tell him that.
What? Only love makes you that crazy, sweetheart.
And that damn stupid.
[sighs] Found some ice.
Thanks.
[sniffs] [sighs] Everything okay? Yeah.
Everything's fine.

Do you remember how he said he was looking for the gate? - [Mike] Yeah.
- What if he found it? [Lucas shouting indistinctly on radio] What's he saying? I don't know, he's way out of range.
[Lucas] son of a bitch! Lucas, if you can hear us, slow down.
We can't understand you.
Yes, I copy! Do you? They know about Eleven! Get out of there! They know about Eleven! The bad men are coming! All of them! Do you hear me? The bad men are coming! "Mad hen.
" Does that mean anything to you? Like a code name or something? - [Lucas] The bad men are coming! - "Bad men.
" - Bad men! - [radio static] [gasps] Stay here.
[Mike] What's that guy doing? You don't think Well, I know she and Steve have been spending some time together, - so I thought maybe - Mom! [stammers] Well, is he home? - Maybe you could ask him? - Mom! I'm sorry, can you just hold on, please? Michael, I'm on the phone.
I've told you a million times - Did you schedule any repairs? - What? Is there anyone supposed to come and do repairs on the house? I don't understand.
Is there something wrong - No, Mom, nothing's wrong in the house.
- [Dustin] Mike! - One second.

Friends friends don't lie.
I'm sorry, too.
[Mike] Me, too.
[theme music playing] Hey.
Jonathan? Jesus, what what happened? - [Callahan] Ma'am - I'm fine.
Why is he wearing handcuffs? Well, your boy assaulted a police officer.
That's why.
- Take them off.
- I am afraid I cannot do that.
- Take them off! - You heard her.
Take 'em off.
Chief, I get everyone's emotional here, but there's something you need to see.
What is this? Why don't you ask your son? We found it in his car.
- What? - Why are you going through my car? Is that really the question you should be asking right now? I wanna see you in my office.
You won't believe me.
[softly] Why don't you give me a try? Mike? Mike? [sighs] [doorbell rings] Yeah, just a minute, please! - [under breath] Jiminy Christmas.
- [doorbell continues ringing] Hold your horses.
Mr.
Wheeler? Yes? [men speaking indistinctly] [Karen stuttering] I don't understand.
You think my son is hiding this girl? What happened to her hair? We just need to know if you've seen her in the past week.
- No, no.
- Absolutely not.
Our son with a girl? [chuckles] I mean, believe me, if he had a girl sleeping in this house, we'd know about it.
Wouldn't we? [Karen sighs] This girl what has she done? I'm afraid I can't answer that.
- Oh, my God, is she Russian? - [stammers] - You can't treat us like this.
- I need you to stay calm.
You come into my house, and you tell me that my son is hiding some girl, and that he's in danger, but you can't tell us why? And you, what, you expect me to remain, what, calm? [sighs] I understand how upsetting this is.
I wish we could tell you more but I can tell you that your son, Michael, is in real danger.
We want to help him.
We will help him.
I give you my word.
But in order for me to do that you have to trust me.
Will you trust me? Good.
Now do you have any idea where your son might have gone? [Lucas] This is Randolph Road, right here.
The fence starts here, and goes all the way around.
And this is the lab right here.
The gate's gotta be in there somewhere.
It's gotta be.
[Dustin] Well, who owns Hawkins Lab? The sign says "Department of Energy.
" Department of Energy? What do you think that means? It means government.
Military.
- [Dustin] Then why does it say "Energy"? - Just trust me, all right? It's military.
My dad's told me before.
Mike's right.
There's soldiers out front.
Do they make, like, lightbulbs or something? [Mike] No, weapons to fight the Russians, and commies and stuff.
[Lucas] Weapons.
[gasps] Oh, Jesus, this is bad.
Really bad.
The place is like a fortress.
Well, what do we do? [Mike] I don't know, but we can't go home.
We're fugitives now.
[helicopter approaching] [stutters] Guys? Do you hear that? - [Mike] Go, go, go, go! - [Dustin] Come on, come on! - It's stuck.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go! - [Mike] Hurry up! Hurry, come on! - [Lucas] Come on! [Dustin] Go, go, go, go, go, go! [helicopter whirring] - [panting] - [Lucas] Get down! [helicopter receding] Mental.
[Joyce sighs] You say blood draws this thing? We don't know.
It's just a theory.
[Jonathan] I'm sorry, Mom.
What, you're sorry? You're you're sorry? - That is not good enough, Jonathan.
- I know.
That's not even close.
That's not even in the in the ballpark.
I wanted to tell you, I just What if this thing took you, too? You risked your life and Nancy's.
[stammers] I thought I could save Will I still do.
This is not yours to fix alone.
[stammers] You act like you're all alone out there in the world, but you're not.
You're not alone.
I know.
[sighs] God damn it, Jonathan.
- I know.
- Damn it.
[sniffling] [Troy's mom] I want an apology! [Callahan] An apology for what, exactly? [Troy's mom] Where is the chief? I want to speak to him - right this instant.
- Stay here.
Ma'am, I need you to calm down.
What is your name, Deputy? Well, I'm an officer [chuckles] okay? [Troy's mom] Name and badge number, both of you! - What the hell is going on here? - [Powell] Chief These men are humiliating my son.
- No, no, no.
Okay, that's not true.
- Yes.
There was some kind of fight, Chief A psychotic child broke his arm! - A little girl, Chief.
A little one.
- That tone! Do you hear that tone? Honestly, I'm just trying to state a fact.
- I don't have time for this.
- It was a little girl Will you please take a statement [mouthing] and get her out? - [Callahan] Yes.
- So what'd this girl look like? She had no hair and she was bleeding from her nose.
Like a freak.
What'd you just say? I said she's a freak! No, her hair.
What'd you say about her hair? Her head's shaved.
She doesn't even look like a girl.
And And what? Tell the man, Troy.
She can do things.
What kind of things? Like make you fly.
And piss yourself.
What? Was she alone? She always hangs out with those losers.
"Losers"? What losers? Hey.
You owe me $1.
20.
Don't worry, he'll need more than aspirin when we're done with him.
Yeah, if the creep ever gets out.
The cops should just lock him up forever.
- Did you see the look on his face? - [Steve groans] - Oh.
- [chuckles] He probably had that same look whenever he killed his brother, right? Oh, God, I just got an image of him making that face - while he and Nancy are screwing.
- [chuckles] Carol, for once in your life, shut your damn mouth! - What? - Hey, what's your problem, man? You're both assholes.
That's my problem.
- Are you serious right now, man? - Yeah, I'm serious.
You shouldn't have done that.
- Done what? - You know what.
You mean call her out for what she really is? Oh, that's funny, because I don't remember you asking me to stop.
I should've put that spray paint right down your throat.
- What the hell, Steve? - [Steve] You know, neither of you ever cared about her.
You never even liked her, because she's not miserable like you two.
She actually cares about other people.
The slut with a heart of gold.
I told you to watch your mouth! Hey! I don't know what's gotten into you, man, - but you don't talk to her that way.
- Get out of my face.
- Or what? - [grunts] Or what? You gonna fight me now, too? Huh? You gonna fight me now, too? Because you couldn't take Jonathan Byers so I wouldn't recommend that.
[car door opens] Here, let me get the door for you, buddy.
That's right.
Run away, Stevie boy! Run away! Just like you always do.
That Nancy's turning you into a little pussy! - [tires screeching] - That's right, Harrington, run away! Run away! [scoffs] [Nancy] I have to go home.
No, you can't.
- My mom my dad are there.
- They're gonna be okay.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Let go.
- Let go! - Hey! Listen to me.
Listen to me.
The last thing in the world we need is them knowing you're mixed up in all this.
- Mike is over there - They haven't found him.
Not yet, at least.
[helicopter whirring] - For Mike? - Come on, get in the car.
Look, we need to find them before they do.
Do you have any idea where he might have gone? - No, I don't.
- I need you to think.
I don't know.
We haven't talked a lot.
I mean, lately [sighs] Is there any place that your your parents don't know about that he might go? - [stuttering] I don't know.
- I might.
What? I don't know where he is, but I think I know how to ask him.
Whoa.
I got it.
[helicopter hovering] [Nancy on radio] Mike, are you there? Mike? You guys hear that? Mike, it's me, Nancy.
Mike, are you there? Answer.
Mike, we need you to answer.
Is that your sister? This is an emergency, Mike.
Do you copy? Mike, do you copy? Okay, this is really weird.
Don't answer.
- She said it was an emergency.
- What if it's a trick? - It's your sister! - What if the bad people kidnapped her? What if they're forcing her to say this? I need you to answer.
It's like Lando Calrissian.
Don't answer.
We need to know that you're there, Mike.
Listen, kid, this is the chief.
If you're there, pick up.
We know you're in trouble and we know about the girl.
Why is she with the chief? How the hell does he know about [Hopper] We can protect you, we can help you, but you gotta pick up.
Are you there? Do you copy? Over.
[sighs] Anybody got any other ideas? [Mike] Yeah, I copy.
It's Mike.
I'm here.
We're here.
[Steve] Need a hand? Did you have something to do with this? I just I wanna help.
All yours.
[sighs] They expect us to just sit here like prisoners.
We should be out there looking for him.
Honey, we have to trust them, okay? This is our government.
They're on our side.
[Karen sighs] That man gives me the creeps.
Nancy.
You don't think she's involved in this, too, do you? Nancy with Mike? [chuckles] No.
- No.
- [sighs] [Dustin breathing heavily] Will you stop pacing? It's been way too long.
Do you know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe this is all a trap and the bad men are coming to get us right now! It's not a trap.
Why would the chief set us up? Nancy, maybe, but the chief? Lando Calrissian.
Would you shut up about Lando? I don't feel good about this.
I don't feel good about this! [shouting] When do you feel good about anything? [vehicles approaching] [Dustin] Shit! [Mike] Go, go, go, go.
[panting] Lando.
You think they saw us? Both of you, shut up.
[grunts] - [man 1] Hey! - [blows landing] [man 1 grunts] [man 2] What the [grunting] [door creaks] [breathing heavily] All right, let's go.
Let's go! Mike.
Oh, my God.
Mike! I was so worried about you.
Yeah, uh me, too.
Is that my dress? Okay, so, in this example, we're the acrobat.
Will and Barbara, and that monster, they're this flea.
And this is the Upside Down, where Will is hiding.
Mr.
Clarke said the only way to get there is through a rip of time and space.
- A gate.
- That we tracked to Hawkins Lab.
With our compasses.
Okay, so the gate has a really strong electromagnetic field, and that can change the directions of a compass needle.
Is this gate underground? [Eleven] Yes.
Near a large water tank? Yes.
[stutters] How do you know all that? He's seen it.
[Joyce] Is there any way that you could that you could reach Will? That you could talk to him in this The Upside Down.
[whispering] Down.
Yeah.
[Nancy] And my friend Barbara? Can you find her, too? [static] [static increases] [static becomes faint] I'm sorry.
What? [stuttering] What's wrong? What happened? [voice breaks] I can't find them.
[turns faucet off] [Mike] Whenever she uses her powers, she gets weak.
The more energy she uses, the more tired she gets.
- Like, she flipped the van earlier.
- It was awesome.
- But she's drained.
- Like a bad battery.
Well [stutters] How do we make her better? We don't.
We just have to wait and try again.
[Nancy] Well, how long? I don't know.
[Eleven] The bath.
[Joyce] What? I can find them.
In the bath.
[screaming] [woman] Oh! Oh.
Oh, my No, mmm-mmm.
Hey, you know how they did that? You know what that is? [sighing] No, what? Melted plastic and microwaved bubble gum.
[woman] No way.
Really? Really.
[phone ringing] - What in the world? - Do you want me to pause it? I'm sure it's just a wrong number.
Hello? Mr.
Clarke? It's Dustin.
Dustin? Is everything okay? Yeah, yeah.
I just, I I have a science question.
It's ten o'clock on Saturday.
Why don't we pick this up Do you know anything about sensory deprivation tanks? Specifically how to build one? Sensory deprivation? [stutters] What is this for? Fun.
Okay.
Well Why don't we talk about it Monday? After school, okay? You always say we should never stop being curious.
To always open any curiosity door we find.
Dustin Why are you keeping this curiosity door locked? [sighs] Uh-huh.
[indistinct chatter over phone] Uh-huh.
How much? Uh-huh.
Yep, all right.
Yeah, we'll be careful.
Definitely.
All right, Mr.
Clarke.
Yeah, I'll see you on Monday.
I'll see you on Monday, Mr.
Clarke.
Bye.
Do you still have that kiddie pool we bobbed for apples in? - I think so.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Good.
Then we just need salt.
Lots of it.
How much is "lots"? 1,500 pounds.
Well, where are we gonna get that much salt? [Jonathan grunting] Hey, wait.
It's not gonna snow next week, is it? [sighs] Worst case, no school.
Even if we find Will in there what are we gonna do about that thing? We're not gonna do anything.
I don't want you anywhere near this, all right? Your mom's been through enough already.
He's my brother.
Listen to me.
I'm gonna find him.
All right? You gotta trust me on this.
I am going to find him.
[grunting] This damn thing is heavy.
Come on.
It's upside down.
[Lucas] No, this way.
- Okay, um - How does this even work? - Try that side.
- [grunts] Son of a bitch! - Pull it back.
Pull it back.
- I am! - [Lucas] One, two, three.
- [grunts] Shit! [grunts] Ah.
[Nancy] Stand back.
Whoa.
[Nancy] What did she even eat? - [Mike] What? - Eleven.
[Mike] Oh.
Candy, leftovers, Eggos She really likes Eggos.
[Nancy] I knew you were acting weird.
I just I thought it was because of Will.
I knew you were acting weird, too.
I thought it was 'cause of Steve.
Hey No more secrets, okay? From now on we tell each other everything.
Okay.
Do you like Jonathan now? What? No.
No, it's it's not it's not like that.
Do you like Eleven? What? No.
Ew.
Gross.
This will keep it dark for you.
Just like in your bathtub.
[sighs] You're a very brave girl.
You know that, don't you? Everything you're doing for my boy for Will for my family [sighs] [sniffs] Thank you.
Listen.
I am gonna be there with you the whole time.
And if it ever gets too scary [stutters] in that place, you just let me know, okay? Yes.
Ready? [breath trembling] Ready.
Colder! Warmer! Right there! [static] [sighs] [electricity surging] [breathing heavily] Barb? Barbara? [breathing heavily] [squelching] [bubbling] [gasps] [breathing heavily] [electricity pulsating] - What's going on? - I don't know.

You did so good.
- Are you okay? - [Eleven cries] [Hopper sighs] So this fort.
Where is it? [stutters] Uh, it's in the woods behind our house.
Yeah, he used to go there to hide.
Hey, get back inside.
What, are you insane? - No, I'm - Look, if something happens to me, I don't make it back Yeah, but then I'll go.
You stay.
Are you kidding me? He's my son, Hop.

- [Hopper] Joyce, come on! - Please.
I'm gonna find him.
I'm gonna find him.
[engine starting] [door closes] [tires screeching] [door opens] [door slams] We have to go back to the station.
What? Your mom and Hopper are just walking in there like bait.
That thing is still in there.
And we can't just sit here and let it get them, too.
We can't.
[sighs] You still wanna try it out? I wanna finish what we started.
I want to kill it.
So this is your plan? Worked for me before, didn't it? - Well, did it? - Come on, trust me.
[announcer on radio] I'd like to hear your thoughts on the war.
I think we're dealing with a whole different environment here.
[announcer 2] I'll tell you what, we always planned on the Russians massing the fire and we [Hopper sighs] - [Joyce gasps] - [man] Don't move! - All right, move in.
- [guns cocking] It's all right.
Let me do the talking.
[indistinct radio chatter] [Will softly] If I go there will be trouble [shuddering] And if I stay it will be double So, come on and let me know Should I stay or should I go now? [monster growling] [footsteps approaching] [growling continues] [breathing heavily] [growling] [growling stops] [monster growls] 
----------
[insects chirping] [Joyce yelling] Let me out of here! Somebody, please! [grunts] Let me out! [door unlocking] [Joyce breathing heavily] [Dr.
Brenner] Your son.
We know you've been in contact with him.
- [stammering] You have to let me - When and how did you make contact with him? - What? - Hmm? Six.
What? Six.
Six people have been taken this week.
This thing that took your son [softly] we don't really understand it.
But its behavior is predictable.
Like all animals it eats.
It will take more sons.
More daughters.
I want to save them.
I want to save your son.
But I can't do that.
Not without your help.
Stop.
I know who you are.
I know what you've done.
You took my boy away from me! You left him in that place to die! You faked his death! We had a funeral.
We buried him.
And now you're asking for my help? Go to hell.
- [electricity crackling] - [groaning] - [breathing heavily] - Okay, now what do you know? I'm sorry.
Did I stutter? I told you.
Everything.
[electricity crackling] What do you know? [panting] I know you do experiments on kidnapped little kids, whose parents' brains you've turned to mush.
And I know you went a little too far this time and you messed up in a big way.
I mean, you really messed up, didn't you? Big time.
That's why you're trying to cover your tracks.
You killed Benny Hammond, you faked Will Byers' death.
You made it look like that little girl just ran away.
See, I told you.
- I know everything.
- All right, who are you working with? Nobody.
But I did give all this over to my friend at the Times.
He's gonna blow this thing wide open.
[chuckles] - [electricity crackling] - [groans] [grunting] You're just a junkie.
A small town cop who had a really bad week.
Took one too many pills this time.
You made a mistake coming back here.
No, I didn't.
Here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna let me and Joyce Byers go you're gonna give us anything we need, and we're gonna find her son.
And then we're gonna forget that any of this ever happened.
Oh, is that right? Yeah.
That's right.
Nancy? Jonathan? [door closes] - They're gone.
- What? Nancy and Jonathan.
His car's gone.
They're probably just sucking face somewhere.
- [Lucas] Gross.
- No.
No way! Did they go with the chief? I don't know.
No.
What? Did you see them? Do you know where they went? - Yes.
- Where? Where did they go? Demogorgon.
[sighs] Where's the girl? [inhales deeply] [exhales] You gotta give me your word.
Nobody's ever gonna find out about this.
And those other three kids, those boys, you're gonna leave them alone.
Then I'll tell you.
Tell you where your little science experiment is.
[sighs] [gasps] I don't understand.
We came to an agreement.
What? Look, everything that's happened here and everything that's gonna happen, we don't talk about.
You want Will back? This place had nothing to do with it.
That's the deal.
You got it? What is this? Protection.
The atmosphere is toxic.
[stutters] But my son's in there.
He Put it on.
[Connie] I'm telling you, this is a mistake.
[Dr.
Brenner] It's gone.
Isn't that what you wanted? And if they find the boy? That's not gonna happen.
[low growling] [theme music playing] [Joyce breathing heavily] [Hopper] Hey, you all right? [Joyce] Yeah.
[Hopper echoing] I need you to relax, okay? I want you to slow down your breathing, take deep breaths.
In and out.
Deep breath in and out.

One two You don't have to do this Jonathan, stop talking.
- I'm just saying, you don't have to - Three.
[Mike] Guys, guys! This is crazy.
We can't just wait around.
Mike, in case you forgot, we're still fugitives.
The bad men are still looking for us.
Yeah, and we don't even know where your sister is.
El can find them.
Mike, look at her.
I still think we should stick to the chief's plan.
Exactly.
We stay here, keep El out of sight and keep her safe.
That's the most important thing, remember? Besides, she's okay.
She's with Jonathan.
Yeah, and she's kind of a badass now, so Well, where are you going? You just said stick to the plan! I am.
I'm just gonna go get some chocolate pudding.
I'm telling you, Lunch Lady Phyllis hoards that shit.
[Mike] Are you serious? El needs to be recharged! [door opens] [door shuts] [faint creaking] Did you hear that? It's just the wind.
Don't worry.
My mom, she said the lights speak when it comes.
Speak? Blink.
Think of them as alarms.
Is that too tight? [stutters] No, it's fine.
Thanks.
Nancy? Yeah? - [banging on door] - [both gasp] [Steve] Jonathan? Are you there, man? It's it's Steve! Listen, I just want to talk! [banging on door continues] - Steve, listen to me.

[electricity jolts] Do you hear anything? No.
[door opening] [Joyce echoing] Will! Will! [breathing heavily] Will! Will! [indistinct sobbing] [Hopper] "I asked Mrs.
Spencer what made them red and she said she didn't know and for pity's sake not to ask her any more questions.
She said I must have asked her a thousand already.
I suppose I had, too, but how are you gonna find things out if you don't ask questions? And what does make roads red? 'Well, I don't know, ' said Matthew.
It just makes me feel glad to be alive it's such an interesting world.
" [sobbing] [Joyce yelling] Will! [Hopper] Will! [Steve muttering] This is crazy.
This is crazy.
This is crazy.
This is crazy! This is crazy! This is crazy! What are you do What are you doing? Are you insane? It's going to come back! So you need to leave.
Right now.
[electricity pulsating] [both breathing heavily] [Nancy] Where is it? [Jonathan] Come on.
Come on, you son of a bitch.
- You see it? - No.

[monster screeching] Did you hear that? [screeching continues faintly] Get back! [grunting] - [Jonathan panting] - [all coughing] [all panting] [Nancy] Where did it go? [Jonathan] No.
It has to be dead.
[panting] It has to be.
[Hopper] Come on.
[Joyce] Is that my house? [door creaking] [Jonathan gasps] [Jonathan sighs] [Hopper] It was hurt.
[Steve panting] Mom.
[Jonathan echoing] Is that you? Mom.
Jonathan? [Hopper] Joyce, come on.
[crackling] Where's it going? I don't think that's the monster.
Found it! I knew she was hoarding it.
- I knew it.
- Yeah.
Always lying, saying she's out.
Bald-faced liar.
Mike, I found the chocolate pudding! Okay! Are you feeling any better? [sighs] What's "putting"? [chuckles] Pudding, it's it's this chocolate goo you eat with a spoon.
Don't worry, when all this is over, you won't have to keep eating junk food and leftovers like a dog anymore.
My mom, she's a pretty awesome cook.
She can make you whatever you like.
Eggos? Well, yeah, Eggos, but real food, too.
[sighs] See, I was thinking, once all this is over and Will's back and you're not a secret anymore, my parents can get you an actual bed for the basement.
Or you can take my room if you want, since I'm down there all the time anyways.
My point is, they'll take care of you.
They'll be like your new parents, and Nancy, she'll be like your new sister.
Will you be like my brother? What? No, no.
[scoffs] Why "no"? Because [sighs] 'cause it's different.
Why? [sighs] I mean, I don't know, I guess it's not.
It's stupid.
Mike? Yeah? Friends don't lie.
[sighing] Well I was thinking I don't know maybe we can go to the Snow Ball together.
- "Snow Ball"? - It's this cheesy school dance, where you go in the gym and dance to music and stuff.
I've never been, but I know you're not supposed to go with your sister.
- No? - I mean you can, but it'd be really weird.
You go to school dances with someone that, you know someone that you like.
- A friend? - Not a friend.
[sighs] Uh uh Uh, someone like a [car approaching] Nancy.
Hold on, I'll be right back.
Stay here.
[tires screeching] - [tires screeching] - [indistinct yelling] [agent] Go! You two, on me.
This will charge your battery right up, I'm telling you.
- [Mike] Guys! Guys! - What is it? [panting] They found us.
[agent] We know they're here.
Be advised, west side of the building is clear.
[agent] Sir, we've searched everywhere.
There's no sign of them.
[indistinct radio chatter] [agent] Nothin'.
Keep it locked down.
[agent] All right.
Kitchen.
[indistinct radio chatter] [panting] How did they find us? I don't know, but they knew we were in the gym.

- She's just drained.
No, no, no, she won't wake up.
El! El! [echoing] El! [Hopper] There's more blood.
Oh, my God.
[Joyce] This way.
- She's barely breathing.
- We gotta go.
[Dr.
Brenner] Leave her.
- Step away from the child.
- [Mike] No! You want her, you have to kill us first.
- That's right! - Eat shit! - Oh, no! No, no! - No! No! Get off me! - [screaming] You idiot! - No! [Dustin] Get off me! [Mike] Ow! Let go! Eleven? Eleven, can you hear me? Eleven? Papa? Yes, yes, it's your papa.
- [Mike] Get off of me.
[grunts] - [Dr.
Brenner] I'm here now.
Let her go! Let her go, you bastard! [whimpering] Shh, shh, you're sick.
You're sick, but I'm going to make you better.
I'm going to take you back home, where I can make you well again.
Where we can make all of this better, so no one else gets hurt.
Bad.
Bad.
Mike.

Will! Will! Will! Oh, my God! Will! Hopper! Oh, my God! You need to help get him out! [Joyce crying] Get him out! [Joyce whimpers] - [grunts] - [tendril hissing] Oh, Jesus.
- [guns firing] - Come on, come on! [Dustin] Oh, my God! [agents yelling indistinctly] Sorry.
Hold on, we're almost there.
We're almost there.
Come on.
[panting] Come on.
Help, help.
Come on, get her on the table.
[Eleven groans] [sighs] Just hold on a little longer, okay? [sniffles] He's gone.
The bad man's gone.
We'll be home soon, and my mom she'll get you your own bed.
You can eat as many Eggos as you want.
[sniffles] And we can go to the Snow Ball.
[softly] Promise? [sniffles] Promise.

You won't believe what happened when you were gone, man.
- It was mental.
- [Lucas] You had a funeral.
- Jennifer Hayes was crying.
- And Troy peed himself.
- What? - In front of the whole school! - [Lucas] Yes! - [coughing] You okay? It got me.
The Demogorgon.
We know.
It's okay.
It's dead.
We made a new friend.
She stopped it.
She saved us.
But she's gone now.
- Her name's Eleven.
- Like the number? Well, we call her "El" for short.
She's basically a wizard.
[whispers] She has superpowers.
More like a Yoda.
[Dustin] She flipped a van with her mind, and these agents were trying to shoot us - Yeah, it flipped over us - Then she squeezed the brains out [Dustin] And blood was pouring out of their faces.
[Mike] It was pouring out of their eyes.
[Lucas] Agents just started grabbing us and stuff - [Dustin] shot out of the wall - [continues indistinctly] [Mike] Something is coming.
Something angry.
Hungry for your blood.
It is almost here.
- What is it? - It's the thessalhydra, I'm telling you.
It's not the thessalhydra.
I'm telling you, it's the thessalhydra.

- [Mike] It roars in anger! - Will, your action! - What should I do? I Fireball him! Fireball the son of a bitch.
- Fourteen! - [all exclaim] Direct hit.
Will the Wise's fireball hits the thessalhydra.
It makes a painful [imitates screeching] and then it crumbles to the ground.
Its clawed hand reaches for you one last time and, and, and and [all cheering] Lucas cuts off its seven heads, and Dustin places them into his bag of holding.
You carry the heads out of the dungeon, victorious, and you present them to King Tristan.
He thanks you for your bravery and service.
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not it, is it? No, there's a medal ceremony Oh, a medal ceremony? What are you talking about? - And - The campaign was way too short.
